I had really high hopes for it but it did not deliver. I admit it is visually good with decent cinematography and coloring but the story and the dialog seem to be written for children. There is absolutely no creativity in this film. It is a stereotype of superhero stories. There is too much superhuman stuff going on. You can't feel connected to anyone here. Everyone seems to be on board with everything. You feel like being dragged into a party where you know no one. None of the characters are relatable, or even interesting for that matter. It feels like you are watching the third movie of a trilogy having watched neither of the previous two.\\n\\nI also believe the movie should be called \"Everyone But Superman\"! Weirdly, he doesn't appear as the main character. He doesn't have a great fight scene or do the important things. He's just there getting bitten up with a very poorly executed redemption arc.\\n\\nAlso, none of the jokes land. The movie isn't fun. None of the characters are funny, especially not the dog. It really tries to be funny but fails every time.

is definitely one of the worst i ve ever seen i had really high hopes for it but it did not deliver i admit it is visually good with decent cinematography and coloring but the story and the dialog seem to be written for children there is absolutely no creativity in this film it is a stereotype of superhero stories there is too much superhuman stuff going on you can t feel connected to anyone here everyone seems to be on board with everything you feel like being dragged into a party where you know no one none of the characters are relatable or even interesting for that matter it feels like you are watching the third movie of a trilogy having watched neither of the previous two i also believe the movie should be called everyone but superman weirdly he doesn t appear as the main character he doesn t have a great fight scene or do the important things he s just there getting bitten up with a very poorly executed redemption arc also none of the jokes land the movie isn t fun none of the characters are funny especially not the dog it really tries to be funny but fails every time i didn t expect this from james gunn

feels way too childish and overly comical the tone is all over the place cringey one liners awkward slapstick and visuals that look like they belong in a saturday morning cartoon instead of being a bold reimagining it feels like a step back into campy territory no one really asked for david corenswet while a decent lookalike completely fails to capture the commanding presence and charisma that henry cavill brought to the role cavill had gravitas a balance of strength vulnerability and quiet intensity corenswet feels light like he s playing dress up rather than embodying earth s greatest protector worse the theater itself reflected the film s flat tone the room was dead quiet barely a chuckle almost no reaction it was a sharp contrast to the electric energy i felt during deadpool vs wolverine where the whole crowd was engaged laughing reacting this superman it just didn t land compared to man of steel which had emotional depth stunning visuals and a powerful score this version feels hollow it might please kids or hardcore nostalgia fans but it s missing soul rating     looks like superman but lacks the heart presence and impact for something truly heroic revisit man of steel

            "SUPERMAN REVIEW - A Bright Start That Never Reaches Orbit\\n\\nThere's no denying it-expectations were high for this reboot. A fresh start, a new tone, and James Gunn in the driver's seat? I was genuinely excited.\\n\\nAnd yes, there are moments where the movie shines... But by the end, I couldn't help but feel let down. And a little frustrated.\\n\\nWhat I Liked:\\n\\nLet's start with the good. This movie looks incredible. The bright color palette-crisp whites, deep blues, bold reds-makes for a visually rich experience. Honestly, it's one of the best comic-book-inspired color treatments in years.\\n\\nThe special effects are slick, especially the concept of Superman drawing strength from solar \"power-ups.\" Creative and fun. The music was solid, the cast delivered, and the Lex Luthor angle-wanting to frame Superman as a threat to land military contracts-was one of the more grounded, believable motivations I've seen from the character.\\n\\nThen the Cracks Start to Show...\\n\\nThe story moves too fast. Emotional beats don't land because we never build up to them. We just drop in.\\n\\nClark's first major loss? Already happened when the film starts.\\n\\nClark and Lois? Already dating-no tension, no romance arc.\\n\\nNo identity conflict, no real inner struggle. One of the most iconic elements of Superman's character just isn't there.\\n\\nAnd here's where I get seriously frustrated: Superman is supposed to be the most powerful meta-human on Earth. That's not just hype-it's canon.\\n\\nBut in this movie? He gets his ass kicked. A lot.\\n\\nHe's constantly on the ropes, getting beaten, almost killed, and barely making it out. And worst of all? He never really has that moment where he turns the tide, where he dominates, where he wins.\\n\\nInstead, Mr. Terrific is solving the problems. He's rescuing people. He's driving the plot forward. Superman's just kind of... there.\\n\\nAnd sure, I love seeing other characters shine-but not at the cost of Superman's entire presence.\\n\\nEven worse? There are way too many characters that feel like they could easily take him out. It robs the story of any awe or scale. If everyone can beat Superman, then what even makes him Superman?\\n\\nAnd while we're at it-Green Lantern and Morph? Great additions, barely used. Huge missed opportunity.\\n\\nTo top it off, Clark and Superman have the same tone-both a little too goofy and immature. There's no real difference between the persona and the hero. Superman should feel iconic, larger than life... inspiring. Here, he feels like just another guy in a cape.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\nThis movie had real potential. It had the cast. It had the budget. It had the visual style.\\n\\nBut it lacked soul, build-up, and-most frustrating of all-respect for Superman's power and presence.\\n\\nI walked in hopeful. I walked out thinking, \"How did they make Superman feel this small?\"\\n\\n⭐ Score: 6.3/10 - Stylish and ambitious, but the Man of Steel spends too much time on the ground.

other characters shine but not at the cost of Superman s entire presence Even worse There are way too many characters that feel like they could easily take him out It robs the story of any awe or scale If everyone can beat Superman then what even makes him Superman And while we re at it Green Lantern and Morph Great additions barely used Huge missed opportunity To top it off Clark and Superman have the same tone both a little too goofy and immature There s no real difference between the persona and the hero Superman should feel iconic larger than life inspiring Here he feels like just another guy in a cape Final Thoughts This movie had real potential It had the cast It had the budget It had the visual style But it lacked soul build up and most frustrating of all respect for Superman s power and presence I walked in hopeful I walked out thinking How did they make Superman feel this small Score       Stylish and ambitious but the Man of Steel spends too much time on the ground superman review a bright start that never reaches orbit there s no denying it expectations were high for this reboot a fresh start a new tone and james gunn in the driver s seat i was genuinely excited and yes there are moments where the movie shines but by the end i couldn t help but feel let down and a little frustrated what i liked let s start with the good this movie looks incredible the bright color palette crisp whites deep blues bold reds makes for a visually rich experience honestly it s one of the best comic book inspired color treatments in years the special effects are slick especially the concept of superman drawing strength from solar power ups creative and fun the music was solid the cast delivered and the lex luthor angle wanting to frame superman as a threat to land military contracts was one of the more grounded believable motivations i ve seen from the character then the cracks start to show the story moves too fast emotional beats don t land because we never build up to them we just drop in clark s first major loss already happened when the film starts clark and lois already dating no tension no romance arc no identity conflict no real inner struggle one of the most iconic elements of superman s character just isn t there and here s where i get seriously frustrated superman is supposed to be the most powerful meta human on earth that s not just hype it s canon but in this movie he gets his ass kicked a lot he s constantly on the ropes getting beaten almost killed and barely making it out and worst of all he never really has that moment where he turns the tide where he dominates where he wins instead mr terrific is solving the problems he s rescuing people he s driving the plot forward superman s just kind of there and sure i love seeing

End of story.\\n\\nReally though, the story line is not a strong one and is full of weak characters as well. It just doesn't come together well. The characters are weak and there is zero context to most relationships. Ma and Pa are dumb Kansas hicks, total insult to anyone from Kansas. The dog is... well just plain annoying CG, but at least he can rescue Superman. Cousin is a drunk party girl. Green lantern is a party of one, a very poorly written character that is not in line with the true Green Lantern but he does know how to flip people off with a huge green hand. Kat Grant is only there for the cleavage. Hawk Girl... cover your ears, she only screams. Lex? We don't know why he has a problem with Superman or why he is trying to get his own country. What about his team? They are just gamers. Do they actually know what is happening? Lois is under developed as a main character. Jimmy is actually likable and gets a few things done. Mr. Terrific is helpful as he saves the city, however his isn't likable at all. I could go on. Superman is weak and vulnerable as he gets in touch with his touchy feely side. As I said, no character development. No relationship development whatsoever. These are not bad actors, it is bad script. You really need to watch Smallville and all other Superman movies to gain any context to this movie.

rescued by his cousins dog End of story Really though the story line is not a strong one and is full of weak characters as well It just doesn t come together well The characters are weak and there is zero context to most relationships Ma and Pa are dumb Kansas hicks total insult to anyone from Kansas The dog is well just plain annoying CG but at least he can rescue Superman Cousin is a drunk party girl Green lantern is a party of one a very poorly written character that is not in line with the true Green Lantern but he does know how to flip people off with a huge green hand Kat Grant is only there for the cleavage Hawk Girl cover your ears she only screams Lex We don t know why he has a problem with Superman or why he is trying to get his own country What about his team They are just gamers Do they actually know what is happening Lois is under developed as a main character Jimmy is actually likable and gets a few things done Mr Terrific is helpful as he saves the city however his isn t likable at all I could go on Superman is weak and vulnerable as he gets in touch with his touchy feely side As I said no character development No relationship development whatsoever These are not bad actors it is bad script You really need to watch Smallville and all other Superman movies to gain any context to this movie

Now was it funny from time to time? Sure. Was it decently entertaining? Yep. But, damn that storyline was ALL OVER THE PLACE. Honestly I thought it had a really strong start. The first 30 minutes seemed to be fairly cohesive. From there we just get introduced to more and more random characters who ultimately distract from the story. Almost every character is purely a plot device used to move things on as the movie progresses. We get some character development with Lois and Clark but even their relationship feels choppy often. The further you get in the movie the more confusing it gets.

mess Now was it funny from time to time Sure Was it decently entertaining Yep But damn that storyline was ALL OVER THE PLACE Honestly I thought it had a really strong start The first   minutes seemed to be fairly cohesive From there we just get introduced to more and more random characters who ultimately distract from the story Almost every character is purely a plot device used to move things on as the movie progresses We get some character development with Lois and Clark but even their relationship feels choppy often The further you get in the movie the more confusing it gets

        "\n",
        "This was a challenging but rewarding task. The most challenging part was scraping dynamic websites like GitHub Marketplace, where pages needed to be crawled through to deal with pagination, dynamic page content, and potentially absent elements. Having the scraper effectively extract data without overwhelming servers by skipping delays altogether added an extra level of complexity. Additionally, preprocessing the scraped text meant being extremely careful when it came to cleaning the data, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the dataset for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "My favorite moment was seeing the end-to-end workflow come together: from pulling real-world data in to cleaning and preprocessing it for analysis. It was satisfying to take grimy web content and make it into a usable dataset, highlighting the applied aspect of data engineering and data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "With respect to time offered, I found the time reasonable enough to accomplish the assignment, although handling real-world web data usually brings in some unexpected variables such as dynamic content loading or altered website structures. Generally, the assignment was a harmonious balance of technical complexity and learning experience, and it strengthened my expertise in Python, Selenium, Pandas, and NLP preprocessing."
