"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.

""Dune: Part 2"" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.

Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the modern era.

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.

Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.

Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.

In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In ""Part 2,"" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.

I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.

While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in ""Dune: Messiah"", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.

Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.

"If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.

For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.

I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.",if like love first one appli one person i love one even i think gener audienc well so i hope well box offic i need dune messiah thi everyth i love go movi also han zimmer for book reader id say one take liberti first chang i like better even for part still hit main beat book thing alter the biggest chang time jump therefor certain charact doesnt fulli appear movi contrari book though still use charact differ way i like person i know earli year lock oscar nomin movi best pictur best director best adapt screenplay best edit best cinematographi best score best sound best visual effect best costum best product design best makeup hope rebecca ferguson time best support actress i guess that pretti much everi categori ive type lol
"Dune Part 2 is an epic movie; slickly made, and visually stunning.

But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book, especially the water of life scene and the final battle.

The movie had almost a 3 hour run time, but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance.

It is a beautiful movie, but it feels like it has no soul. The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.

I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.

The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.

I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.

It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",dune part epic movi slickli made visual stun but i explain quit bit friend around read book especi water life scene final battl the movi almost hour run time felt overlong villenu focus much spectacl littl substanc it beauti movi feel like soul the emot connect paul chani vital stori complet lack unbeliev the two main charact good look enough absolut zero chemistri screen i certain zendaya fine actress thing basic facial express one use scowl direct paul i found worst part movi the final fight scene short choppi mess it felt anticlimact unfulfil the harkonen basic reduc bumbl villaini almost cartoonish the end super abrupt differ book left wonder filmmak would want sequel i want reiter isnt bad movi villenu great creat world look live breath cant give life individu charact it like cant see tree forest
"This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!

This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!

Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!

I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!

I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!

"Like the first part, the second part is visually stunning, though having read the book twice, I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties, De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical/mythical core of the story. This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.

Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience. A kind of secular, profane Dune. Still nice, but also a bit disappointing.",like first part second part visual stun though read book twice i regret say unlik david lynch version eighti de villeneuv almost deliber destress mysticalmyth core stori thi make impress view somehow left unsatisfi in de villeneuv hand stori becom one polit grandstand part book relat hidden way fremen natur mission paul mother for exampl second part scene paul atreid becom kwizatz haderach rather weak convinc have left essenc movi becom bit empti visual experi a kind secular profan dune still nice also bit disappoint
"This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie. Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.",thi second part movi set tone much way first movi make movi feel like cram alot stori backdrop way small time frame which logic consid dune span sever novel histori year civil villeneuv howev put focu aesthet rather storytel which make movi bland confus thing watch the pace irregular part drag alot toward end get feel rap unsatisfi speed especi peopl familiair origin materi dont get sen backstori charact made decis made cram stori like dune two part set film probabl stori justic remad tv seri make realli work therefor rewatch rendit dune unlik
"A monumental piece of cinema.

Paced to perfection, uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking, beyond thrilling, with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding. Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring. An entire production on their A-Game.. it's an incredible technical achievement. Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special. Denis Villeneuve's love for 'Dune' shines through every stunning frame.

"This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene.

"I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.

Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale.

"This movie has the same problems as part one. The editing in this is terrible! Scenes don't connect, they start an assignment or story branch, then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests. No idea is complete, nothing gets resolved, and the dialogue is horrendous.

These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow. If you haven't read the books you won't understand anything that's happening here. What we have here is a movie that is really pretty. It maxes out in the visuals category. The sound was hit or miss, but the plot, pacing and characters were all bad.

"Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film.

I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras.

This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically.

"The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no-one seems to really acknowledge... the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he/she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden. Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.

Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.

It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.",the biggest problem movi one crept hollywood last decad noon seem realli acknowledg actor mumbl line low tone turn volum full blast charact yell audienc feel actor power hesh realli realiti bore wooden not mention ear fall sudden explos mumbl gone day actor given role base talent could actual talk normal clear tone like georg clooney overal movi look amaz help peopl overlook bore crap first hour all high rate review fan book fan visual clearli dont go movi entertain between act zendaya dave bautista austin butler florenc pugh movi pick razzi award bad act assum peopl realis empti blank look face involv act it time critic social medium review took head lower back region stop blow averag movi attempt turn classic clearli
"Dune: Part Two is simply Denis Villeneuve's Magnum Opus in his filmography. I've loved this director's work since ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""Arrival"". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!

The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!

There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!

"This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts.

"I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it's as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.

Enough good things have already been said about this movie, so I'll just point out the negatives:

1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.

2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.

3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.

4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.

Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.",i enjoy movi i say good dark knight huge overstat enough good thing alreadi said movi ill point neg all viallian feel quit weak bland never seem pose real threat bautista charact joke baron isnt threaten new villian call good joker peopl also feel gener the new abil paul get also feel conveni easi get charact chang lot instantli jessica suddenli becom complet differ charact goe paul i see may rush movi format pace couldv better paul prophesi prophet that happen surpris etc in way i think better avoid overdon struggl hero clich i prepar feel ten paul never realli felt reason feel ten overal solid technic masterpiec look cinematographi etc movi overal anoth good watch well worth time that complet fine
"In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timothée Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.",in quiet embrac ink page stori unfold timeless sage len filmmak artistri essenc soar masterpiec see think deni villeneuv made visual stun epic stori movi that ever made power stori movi ever told last year movi scale result piec film piec art infin war endgam look like superhero kid entertain type movi adult version star war dune becom intrigu fascin admir movi world alway get excit right marvel univers star war univers let maestro deni villeneuv handl gonna make anoth one im glad abl say think dune part two masterpiec havent felt awe feel pure fascin movi like quit long time noth complain stori visual film felt perfect cannot describ incred visual film mesmer sound score film amaz perform prop timoth chalamet im surpris get nomin best actor oscar next year total deserv absolut need consid dialogu great scene one anoth felt import worth action scene best ive seen perfect stabilis action narrat scene well done hour minut pure grand epic film fill stun visual could possibl imagin intrigu stori tell kept go whole durat good epic great master other strength master true power overal could see deni villeneuv dune final get influenti recognit year specif part two also one greatest sequel ever made dune part two easili best film year far suppos deliv
"From the time this movie has been released it has been described as one of the best sequal ever made,but I feel bad to say this; it's not.

It is still a good movie but it is inferior to the first part.

I haven't read the books and when i watched the first part it was so entertaining and when you know a director like Denis Villeneuev will also make the next part,your expectations increases multiple times.

I can understand they have a book and they are making it according to the source material but still you don't feel that amazement or thrill like the first movie.

For me the biggest reason is not hiring the writer of the first movie Eric Roth.

He is a damn good writer and has written movies like Forrest gump,The curious case of Benjamin button and etc.

I don't know the reason why he wasn't there for this movie. But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.

They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.

It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.

I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.

Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.

You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.

"Both films are pretty consistent in the sense of, they both look amazing. The sound and score is top tier (Hans Zimmer). The action sequences ARE good when they actually happen (which is not very often.) The actors are all good actors. But they're both just straight up boring films to the core.

I don't understand how people write reviews calling it 'masterpiece' or 'the peak of film making.' I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.

It just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past. Or they're just Timothy Chalamet groupies (I'm a big fan of him as an actor in his other work) and just want him to do well. I refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good (thus making it entertaining) and it's not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like Mad Max Fury Road did.

"After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting.

The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow.

The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.

It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.

One of the best movies of 2024 for sure.",after watch advanc screen blown away part dune it continu seamlessli part master soundtrack action scene act the movi flew despit almost three hour the pace incred well done noth felt fast slow the cgi incred realist charact portray well lead actor the chemistri charact felt real noth felt fake forc it truli difficult find movi contain everyth flawless screenplay write sound act pace dune one best movi sure
"Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.

I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.

In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.

We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.

A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.

I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.

The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.

Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.

I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.

"I couldn't see Christopher Walken as embodying a character in this. I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.

And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.

Also the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a two-part movie. I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.

Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length.

"Here I'll conflate both of Villeneuve's Dunes within one critic: It is a slow, wide, deep and bare opus, best viewed on the biggest possible screen and sound system, in typical Villeneuve fashion.

I didn't read the books but I saw the 1984 movie, and Villeneuve's version is built to become a classic, even if less spectacular or outrageous. What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.

Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.

On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars.",here ill conflat villeneuv dune within one critic it slow wide deep bare opu best view biggest possibl screen sound system typic villeneuv fashion i didnt read book i saw movi villeneuv version built becom classic even less spectacular outrag what realli hit mark austin butler perform coars voic intens demeanor in fact whole sequenc geidi prime best moment movi bleak oppress lightn black sun sciencefict best ala one aspect lessen pleasur zendaya chani i dont know hollywood insist much give femm fatal role everi time i didnt believ instead se charact i see rather plainlook actress limit rang mayb didnt found nich yet on hand act spectrum bautista underr actor offer emot convinc perform in fact nearli actor good par technic team those movi get better everi view a solid star
"I haven't seen the first Chalamet Dune, but I have seen the David Lynch one and personally think it's so much better. I think the cinematography was beautiful in DPT, the acting was great, the accuracy to the books... but I was so bored. It makes me wonder what the goal of making these movies (besides money, duh) was; a modern interpretation of Dune? A deep dive into the character dynamics? A story that would be better appreciated with improved CGI? Beats me.

My opinion might be controversial, but despite being a well-made movie, I just don't think it's that remarkable. Lynch's Dune was bizarre, had that beloved retro sci-fi vibe, WAY more memorable character designs, and just left more of an impression on me. Accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic, but unless the author is making the movie themself, why expect perfect duplication?

My recommendation: unless you're a die-hard Dune fan, you can definitely skip this one.",i havent seen first chalamet dune i seen david lynch one person think much better i think cinematographi beauti dpt act great accuraci book i bore it make wonder goal make movi besid money duh modern interpret dune a deep dive charact dynam a stori would better appreci improv cgi beat my opinion might controversi despit wellmad movi i dont think remark lynch dune bizarr belov retro scifi vibe way memor charact design left impress accuraci book movi also divis topic unless author make movi themself expect perfect duplic my recommend unless your diehard dune fan definit skip one
"Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.

With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.

The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.

See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed.",frank herbert dune wide consid challeng scienc fiction materi adapt big screen in villeneuv hit park dune part one in part two outdo everi way from cinematographi music choreographi act dialogu movi mountain climb prove with han zimmer compos score surpris one well compliment film greig fraser dune part one the creator the batman helm cinematographi realli took breath away magnific vista incred use colour even infrar expert captur motion scale fraser explain shot digit transpos mm back digit thi seem absurd explain digit appear crisp audienc film nostalg hi method obtain perfect balanc i cant fault i agre the real risk cours adapt how retain richest belov scienc fiction lore exist condens hour minut runtim villeneuv took huge risk split first book two part had studio greenlit part two would left half book unsatisfi everyon thank gambl paid abl tell epic stori across two movi border three hour even requir brisk pace mani notabl scene omit despit i think villeneuv retain heart soul stori he creat two movi appeal gener audienc fan alik there much love i cant imagin anyon walk away feel unsatisfi price entri see biggest screen find then see the visual score demand you disappoint
"I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.

Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.

I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the ""twist"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",i want love movi despit confus state throughout film i enjoy i see visual the lack dialogu didnt work although aspect would lessen i learn charact world i dont get much chanc within movi despit uninvolv dune world charact i still honest fault script edit other overarch plot scene happen rather lead scene via emot journey the first hour back forth random test like mani charact simpli appear movi deep runtim includ main villain discern trait evil sake some charact appear briefli dont much the motiv everyon strip script we see abund amount screen time someon ride worm larg battl abrubtli end littl setup did need larg segment screen time involv nuke couldv told there nuke the nuke scene feel standout filler sequenc perhap overshadow dozen moment filler couldv replac plot i would challeng praiser film explain everyth perfect austin butler charact great whi becaus one dimension the battl best you mean snippet battl got one hard tell the score amaz oh unbeliev overus bong nois randomli appear tepid scene even twist end foreshadow first minut thi film spectacl emot payoff the number one prais peopl use describ great dune cinematographi thi leg great movi stand foundat although direct technic look dune epic write edit faulti mayb upon rewatch i would like sinc i might understand detail get detail sourc still nowher good could everyon seem think
"As a sci-fi enthusiast, I approached the latest Dune 2 movie with a sense of anticipation, hoping to be swept away by its grandeur and depth. However, what I encountered left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected. The film seemed to lack the spark that ignites the imagination, opting instead for a plodding pace that failed to engage me fully.

Perhaps it was my own weariness or a misalignment with the source material, but I struggled to find moments worth revisiting after the credits rolled. The supposed ""best scenes"" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.

While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.

In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.",a scifi enthusiast i approach latest dune movi sen anticip hope swept away grandeur depth howev i encount left feel underwhelm disconnect the film seem lack spark ignit imagin opt instead plod pace fail engag fulli perhap weari misalign sourc materi i struggl find moment worth revisit credit roll the suppos best scene seem blur togeth haze monotoni leav search standout moment two cling while i appreci effort filmmak ambit behind bring belov stori life i cant help feel overwhelm hype surround adapt somewhat unwarr despit visual spectacl starstud cast dune left yearn deeper connect stronger emot reson simpli wasnt present in end film may find audienc among diehard fan franchis particular affin theme fell short lofti expect set predecessor fail leav last impress
"I had the joy of watching this movie early, and was nothing short of amazed. Simply put this movie is one of the best crafted, and most impressive films I have ever seen. The casting is spectacular, and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well. The camera angles are creative and unique, showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways (even surpassing the quality of Dune part One). This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come.

"Great movies should always leave you with a feeling during or after seeing them.

While this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece by many, I felt that it didn't give me the feeling of chills that Dune part 1 made feel multiple times.

Those who say that it is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made should be arrested at once.

This movie had all the ingredients to actually be a modern day masterpiece but it feels like Dennis was a bit restraint to go all the way, as if he could not dare to be free and do things he could have done with the story and action.

That being said, Dune part 2 is an amazing movie and I will see it again.

However. While I've seen the part 1 more than 6 times, I don't think part 2 will have that effect on me.

"I have said that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Dune: Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer.

Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism.

The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot.

A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging.

A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards.

P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year!

P.s.s. Can I make ""ride the worm"" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty?

"The ending really ruined the film for me. The strong love and relation between Paul and Chani is lost, love which is very clearly seen in the whole first 3 books. Giving Chani a bigger role was ok but not at the expense of breaking the love between them. Having read the first book a few times and having seen the 80's movie and 90's TV series I will only say this: it ruined the whole movie for me.

I did expect some changes and different artistic views but this was way too much.

"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE: PART TWO is a review-proof film. Either you watched - and loved - the first part, in which case you have already gone out and seen it. Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.

If you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.

Reason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievement

Reason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.

Caught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.

Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are ""just fine"", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.

Thank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.

Only Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.

Come to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.

The story succeeds, despite the fact that the characters are functionaries in the goal of the story. None of them are well drawn and multidimensional. Apart from this, the nuance of the purpose of the story drives you in and makes you care about them.

"I really liked Dune Part One. So much so I saw it three times in the theater and twice streaming. I was really looking forward to Part Two. Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me.

I felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening.

And then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One.

And oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre.

Don't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch.

"So look, Dune Part 1 by Denis Vilneuve was pretty decent. I'd give that one a 7ish. But part 2 was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movie.

Everyone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces. It's really drab... And in the end I really didn't care about any of the characters. It was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deep.

The music is faux epic and sadly doesn't lend any particular weight to what's ultimately a decent story told in a very boring way.

I'd say the VFX is good - yeah... not bad. But the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring - like going through the motions.

The film has a few good moments, but an epic sci-fi masterpiece of our time this film is not. The silly desert walks are pretty funny though!

Of course it has more action than the first one cause is the full on development of the (anti) hero's journey of Paul ""Muad'dib"" Atreides. Therefore, it showcases more depth and details, plus good plot twists, that justifies the journey and conflict.

But also, by having more storylines, the pace and edition style feels rushed in some moments. The storytelling with its half-explained moments and all of a sudden time jumps doesn't gives the same fluidity that the first one had.

There are several backstories that needed more buildup or evidence to be believable, or else, less cutting out details from the book (even though that means longer movies and more fast & furious type of movie fans complaining about ""way too long"" movies).

Of course, the ending is grandiloquent as a space opera like Dune should be. But the first two acts of the movie could have been better. Not in its photography, music or overall production value (which are amazing), just in the telling of a story that evidently has a lot of branches that needed more room to grow.",deni villeneuv never fail amaz beauti movi look and one except of cours action first one caus full develop anti hero journey paul muaddib atreid therefor showcas depth detail plu good plot twist justifi journey conflict but also storylin pace edit style feel rush moment the storytel halfexplain moment sudden time jump doesnt give fluiditi first one there sever backstori need buildup evid believ el less cut detail book even though mean longer movi fast furiou type movi fan complain way long movi of cours end grandiloqu space opera like dune but first two act movi could better not photographi music overal product valu amaz tell stori evid lot branch need room grow
"Denis Villeneuve obviously takes Dune very seriously. As it peaks up right where Part One left off, we remain with 1.5 acts that's left of what I refer to as the Dune Duo. A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.

Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.

Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped.

Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.",deni villeneuv obvious take dune serious a peak right part one left remain act that left i refer dune duo a part cours necessari get one duo and fit perfectli part one act stori left dazzl display intens han zimmer continu mani time refer project realli close show after releas addit album full almost hour music besid offici dune part one soundtrack continu quest true soul dune opinion music which lead next point have to watch imax it blow away my popcorn box liter vibrat bass part film visual stun i quit liter jaw drop without give anyth away dune part magnific
"I was only mildly impressed with ""Dune"" (2021). It was a HUGE improvement over David Lynch's 1980s version, that's for sure. But it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities. It was big...but also a bit disappointing despite this bigness. Fortunately, this second film, while also slow, is a bit more interesting to watch and it's battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen. And, fortunately, it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting. While not a perfect version of the second portion of the Frank Herbert book, it is very good and well worth seeing.

My only regrets about the film were minimal. First, the worm scenes were far less interesting than I'd hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground. Also, I had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swords...in a sci-fi epic?! So many swords...when a machine gun or tank would have been so much better! Still, these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your time.

I might say more but there are well over 2000 reviews.

"The true beauty of Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune' films is that if you haven't read the books (which most viewers haven't) - you still get a true sense of the scope of the material.

It's epic - massive. And it's on full display in these gorgeous films. Tragedy, horror and honor.

The director and writers have done a great service to us all...

These are incredible films - films that this ignorant generation, who undoubtebly have no idea of its importance claim their own. Defining an era. Much like Star Wars did in the 70's.

"""Dune: Part Two,"" the highly anticipated continuation of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic novel, builds on the foundation set by its predecessor. The film picks up the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he navigates the treacherous political landscape of Arrakis while embracing his destiny among the Fremen.

Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterpiece. Villeneuve's direction, combined with Greig Fraser's breathtaking cinematography, immerses viewers in the vast, unforgiving desert landscapes and the intricate, otherworldly design of the Dune universe. The special effects are seamless, bringing the sandworms and the unique technology of Herbert's world to life with stunning realism.

The performances are strong across the board, with Chalamet delivering a compelling portrayal of Paul's growth and struggle. Zendaya's expanded role as Chani adds depth to the narrative, and the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac, continue to shine.

However, the film's pacing can be uneven, and its complex plot might be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material. Despite these issues, ""Dune: Part Two"" is an ambitious and visually arresting film that successfully continues the epic saga. It's a must-watch for fans of the genre and the original novel.",dune part two highli anticip continu deni villeneuv adapt frank herbert classic novel build foundat set predecessor the film pick stori paul atreid timoth chalamet navig treacher polit landscap arraki embrac destini among fremen visual dune part two masterpiec villeneuv direct combin greig fraser breathtak cinematographi immers viewer vast unforgiv desert landscap intric otherworldli design dune univers the special effect seamless bring sandworm uniqu technolog herbert world life stun realism the perform strong across board chalamet deliv compel portray paul growth struggl zendaya expand role chani add depth narr support cast includ rebecca ferguson oscar isaac continu shine howev film pace uneven complex plot might challeng unfamiliar sourc materi despit issu dune part two ambiti visual arrest film success continu epic saga it mustwatch fan genr origin novel
"I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen.

Though I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Paul and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen.

Austin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance.

And here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time.",i saw dune xd screen sound system visual dune jaw drop the sound intens time loud drone if interest see movi worth see big screen though i fulli engag hour minut run time i would call dune masterpiec most charact act emot flat i also felt romanc paul chani convinc when stori reach climax i care charact i also think movi spent littl time setup fremen i get oppress harkonnen sacrific lost freedom shown viewer understand emot motiv full assault harkonnen austin butler intens movi it illustr act rang i hope recogn perform and littl nitpicki critic they dont address fremen eat in term world build sort detail necessari make world believ im convinc human could surviv arraki there way could grow crop rais anim did eat synthet food the planet also couldnt sustain gigant worm these huge beast would consum million calori day avail show detail sustain life dri planet would help believ and voic control thing done bene gesserit sort dumb i know book part book doesnt hold time
"Dune part two is definitely an entertaining movie, but as it stands as an 8.8, lets dial it back a bit. The movie itself visually is a masterpiece, but my problem stems from character development and plot rushing. To me it seems like the last half of the movie was supposed to be 3 hours long itself but the whole movie itself was cut under 3 hours. The climactic finish to the film was super fast and felt like the stakes were low because it just went from one thing to the next with no time to breathe. Also Pauls attraites or how ever you spell it, his character pulls a game of thrones esque queem of dragons vibe, where there goals and personality are one thing then dramatically shift seemingly out of no where. Overall it was a good film, a bit long for my taste, but Its worth a watch if you like sci fi.",dune part two definit entertain movi stand let dial back bit the movi visual masterpiec problem stem charact develop plot rush to seem like last half movi suppos hour long whole movi cut hour the climact finish film super fast felt like stake low went one thing next time breath also paul attrait ever spell charact pull game throne esqu queem dragon vibe goal person one thing dramat shift seemingli overal good film bit long tast it worth watch like sci fi
"You would expect a dramatization of this calibre to paint a picture with all the colors of the original story - the ambient backstory of an interstellar empire, the role of the Spice as the only way to traverse the vast space between the planets, the intricate politics around the control of it, the infinite double helix of plans within plans, the clash of civilizations and prophecies, the mutual development of the characters within the story, the specter of philosophies and their cradles.

Well, If you did, you were dead wrong.

All you get is some sturm-und-drang CGI, somewhat fancy panoramas backed by the same old, supposedly, dramatic third-grade Middle Eastern-ish cheesy flute-chants, Fashion Channel panning shots of models in unnatural poses and, well, no and. That's about it.

The acting is pathetic, for the most part. An otherwise fantastic cast of legendary actors were put to reciting stiff dialogue, barely hiding their confusion.

"*NON-SPOILER REVIEW*

Wow! This is just beyond. Beyond my imagination. Beyond what I was expecting. Beyond all previous iterations of this story put to film. Such an epic! Can't wait for more of this Saga 😊😉

I was quite surprised they didn't do a weird time jump. I loved the fan intro before the film and they called it a saga, so...I'm expecting they are making more, but I heard recently, this is the last Dune film from this director sadly. I hope they take this like they did Harry Potter and keep the same style and fluidity.

This film definitely had more action that the first film. They got up close and in person with it, which worked really well.

Great character development which wasn't rushed. The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.

Cinematography was epic like the previous film 🎥

Acting was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.

The whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.

The ""Narrating"" was done properly and not distracting.

I'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.

P. S.> Even though it was a long film, I didn't see one person get up to go to the bathroom. There was always something on screen worth watching.

"A real movie captivates through compelling storytelling, strong character development, and immersive visuals and sound. It transcends mere entertainment to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and resonate with audiences on a deeper level. Today, cinema needs to balance innovation with tradition, blending advanced technology like CGI with strong narrative substance to meet audience expectations. Modern viewers seek originality, relatability, and escapism.

"I cried the last few minutes of pure explosion of stimuli. Cinema understanding the spectacle as few filmmakers understand today. A film that I have to process to begin trying to break down but that at first impression I simply have to surrender to that confession that it captivated me through the senses to the point of tears, as I would expect from this type of cinema; which in the last 10 years has fallen and there is no bottom to its decline. I was captured by the sound, by the most crystalline screen I have ever experienced, and since the guttural sound of the opening shook my stomach, I didn't think about anything else for almost 3 hours. I was not a child enjoying it, I was an adult surrendering to the experience. One that I assure you, was a first. 31 years of theaters and Dune 2 made me feel like the first time again.",i cri last minut pure explos stimulus cinema understand spectacl filmmak understand today a film i process begin tri break first impress i simpli surrend confess captiv sen point tear i would expect type cinema last year fallen bottom declin i captur sound crystallin screen i ever experienc sinc guttur sound open shook stomach i didnt think anyth el almost hour i child enjoy i adult surrend experi one i assur first year theater dune made feel like first time
"Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah.

Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance.

The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica.

Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies.

The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand.

I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top.

Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.",austin butler shed elvi accent timothe chalamet continu sharpen jawlin fremen messiah dune part two absolut scifi masterpiec director deni villeneuv expertli build upon solid foundat laid first film inject polit religion romanc the act fantast standout austin butler psychot creepi feydrautha along rebecca ferguson take someth total differ last film character ladi jessica greig fraser also standout cinematograph along entir vfx team thi group incred talent use limit color palett creat stunningli realist sandworm spaceship otherworldli armi the sound mix depart han zimmer score also work hand hand creat oddli plea yet deafen imax theater experi thi film loud grand i also respect deni villeneuv stick gun film sicario doesnt want glorifi violenc want show effect victim while film visual stun violenc it brutal top overal dune showcas best scifi offer great adapt frank herbert space drama creat top tier act product
"This movie grabs you by the throat from the very first and keeps you engaged throughout. The visuals are stunning and there is finally a little (I mean a little) more time spent developing plot lines in a more digestible format. In the first Dune, characters appeared and disappeared so quickly that you really didn't care what happened to them. Dune 2 is very long, but I guess that's a given with such a dense story.

What is missing is any true connection made with the characters. There is no exploration of Paul's inner thoughts or struggles or conflicts, he's just always the hero. The love story doesn't develop, it just happens, and Zendaya basically just scowls or looks confused throughout the movie. Also, there is so much crammed into the movie that there were plot leaps that weren't fully explained, so that diminishes your full investment, you just let the visuals and spectacle roll over you. To be a successful movie doesn't mean that every book element needs to be included; editing would have created a more well-rounded and emotionally impactful flick.

I do recommend, as a spectacle and fascinating other world creation. But great it is not in other aspects.",thi movi grab throat first keep engag throughout the visual stun final littl i mean littl time spent develop plot line digest format in first dune charact appear disappear quickli realli didnt care happen dune long i guess that given den stori what miss true connect made charact there explor paul inner thought struggl conflict he alway hero the love stori doesnt develop happen zendaya basic scowl look confus throughout movi also much cram movi plot leap werent fulli explain diminish full invest let visual spectacl roll to success movi doesnt mean everi book element need includ edit would creat wellround emot impact flick i recommend spectacl fascin world creation but great aspect

The perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a Messiah. Chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world. Please go see Part 2 as quickly as possible and in IMAX.

"What a looker Timothée Chalamet is. With his green eyes, androgynous face and smooth curly hair, he is so photogenic all the time, that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments, you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials he's recently been in under the direction of Martin Scorsese. And Denis Villeneuve knows this.

So much so, in fact, that he's decided to hype us up even more in ""Part Two"", again taking his time, making sure the light on Chalamet's should-be insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to ""Lawrence of Arabia""--the timeless masterpiece epic that Villeneuve also adores. So yeah, the teasing here has intensified; but so did the good things: the anti-elitist themes found in Frank Herbert's novel now go deeper into themes of faith, religion and manipulation; the scope is grander; the cinematography? Jaw-dropping! Especially the black and white homeworld of the Harkonnen, Giedi Prime, on which Austin Butler's villainous Feyd-Rautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin. And for the first time in Villeneuve's career, there are genuinely funny moments too.

Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a better movie than its predecessor. And it's quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie. Instead, Villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting Herbert's novel to its full power. And it pays off. Even if there is no catharsis in ""Part Two"", the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal. Without going into the chunky plot, just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for what's to come.

Is a dangerous game director/writer Denis Villeneuve is playing by making so many promises. Or maybe it's not. I am sure a lot of people already felt fully satisfied with this movie even at this point. My friend whom I saw the movie with absolutely swears by it, calling it one of the greatest sci-fi movies in recent history. Me? I hope to be able to say the same about its sequel--or sequels?

"""Dune: Part Two"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic saga, deserving a perfect 10/10 for its intricate storytelling, breathtaking visual effects, and the depth of its political and romantic subplots.

One of the most captivating elements of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the love story between Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya). Their relationship is developed with a genuine emotional depth that enhances the film's narrative. The chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya is palpable, adding a layer of warmth and humanity amidst the grandiose and often harsh environment of Arrakis. Their love story is not just a subplot but a driving force that shapes their characters' motivations and decisions, making the audience deeply invested in their journey.

The exploration of different factions and space politics is another area where ""Dune: Part Two"" excels. Denis Villeneuve masterfully delves into the complex political landscape of the Dune universe, where alliances are fragile, and power struggles are constant. The depiction of the various factions, including the noble House Atreides, the sinister House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic Bene Gesserit, is detailed and compelling. Each faction's distinct motivations and strategies are intricately woven into the plot, creating a rich tapestry of intrigue and conflict.

The film's visual effects continue to be a standout feature, with the same level of artistry and attention to detail that made the first installment so visually stunning. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with breathtaking realism, and the depiction of the space battles and the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes immerse the audience in this vast and detailed universe.

Villeneuve's direction ensures that every frame serves the story, balancing grand epic moments with intimate character-driven scenes. The pacing of the film is expertly managed, with each scene building on the previous one to create a crescendo of tension and excitement. The fight scenes are choreographed with precision, making them feel both brutal and graceful, and the strategic battles highlight the tactical brilliance of the characters involved.

The performances are uniformly excellent. Timothée Chalamet continues to impress as Paul Atreides, capturing the complexity of a young man burdened with immense destiny. Zendaya brings strength and sensitivity to her role as Chani, while the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Stellan Skarsgård, deliver powerful performances that add depth to the narrative.

In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of the saga, blending a captivating love story with intricate political intrigue and stunning visual effects. It not only meets but exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessor, making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. This film cements the Dune series as a landmark in cinematic history and deserves a perfect 10/10.",dune part two outstand continu epic saga deserv perfect intric storytel breathtak visual effect depth polit romant subplot one captiv element dune part two love stori paul atreid timoth chalamet chani zendaya their relationship develop genuin emot depth enhanc film narr the chemistri chalamet zendaya palpabl ad layer warmth human amidst grandios often harsh environ arraki their love stori subplot drive forc shape charact motiv decis make audienc deepli invest journey the explor differ faction space polit anoth area dune part two excel deni villeneuv master delv complex polit landscap dune univers allianc fragil power struggl constant the depict variou faction includ nobl hous atreid sinist hous harkonnen enigmat bene gesserit detail compel each faction distinct motiv strategi intric woven plot creat rich tapestri intrigu conflict the film visual effect continu standout featur level artistri attent detail made first instal visual stun the landscap arraki render breathtak realism depict space battl intric design spaceship costum immers audienc vast detail univers villeneuv direct ensur everi frame serv stori balanc grand epic moment intim characterdriven scene the pace film expertli manag scene build previou one creat crescendo tension excit the fight scene choreograph precis make feel brutal grace strateg battl highlight tactic brillianc charact involv the perform uniformli excel timoth chalamet continu impress paul atreid captur complex young man burden immens destini zendaya bring strength sensit role chani support cast includ rebecca ferguson javier bardem stellan skarsgrd deliv power perform add depth narr in conclus dune part two master continu saga blend captiv love stori intric polit intrigu stun visual effect it meet exce high expect set predecessor make mustse fan newcom alik thi film cement dune seri landmark cinemat histori deserv perfect
"While it without a doubt is a masterclass in editing, cinematography, SOUND DESIGN :0, casting I can't seem to ignore the glaring flaws. The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.

Even though there is no doubt about its ""epicness"" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.

The third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.

Overall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past. It is one of the great modern sci fi's but dare I say, didn't exactly live up to the hype.

"Cinematography is visually stunning and awe inspiring. The sound design is incredible, especially of the weaponry. The rifle shots look and sound futuristic yet realistic. Captures the essence of the book while cutting out superfluous parts of the book and also avoiding some of the controversial stuff like the Harah character. The entire cast nail their performances. I do wish Denis left in the ecology bits but I understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length. Ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book I guess. Chani overall was a bit more independent and less ""submissive."" In the book Chani accepts some ""traditional"" gender roles while in the movie it clear that Chani is never subservient to Paul. I knew they would ""update"" the story for today's society so the changes expected.",cinematographi visual stun awe inspir the sound design incred especi weaponri the rifl shot look sound futurist yet realist captur essenc book cut superflu part book also avoid controversi stuff like harah charact the entir cast nail perform i wish deni left ecolog bit i understand runtim kept reason length end chang femal empow book i guess chani overal bit independ less submiss in book chani accept tradit gender role movi clear chani never subservi paul i knew would updat stori today societi chang expect
"Dune Part 2 is a visually stunning yet somewhat disjointed cinematic experience.

Villeneuve's direction is undeniably ambitious, and his signature style of breathtaking visuals is on full display in Dune. The black and white scenes, reminiscent of archival footage from fascist Germany, are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytelling.

However, the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired. The narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes. It appears that an abundance of material was shot, and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one. Despite these efforts, the film still clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours and 46 minutes.

The plot of Dune Part 2 bears some resemblance to the TV series Game of Thrones, with its complex political machinations, warring factions, and power struggles. However, the film's storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the HBO series. The limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers' ability to fully explore the richness of the source material. Perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the Dune universe and its characters.

In terms of performances, Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha is a standout. Butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role, overshadowing even the lead actor, Timothée Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides. Chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of Butler's Feyd-Rautha, and his performance is merely a shadow in comparison.

Overall, Dune Part 2 is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution. The visual spectacle and moments of brilliance are undeniable, but the disjointed narrative and uneven pacing prevent it from fully realizing its potential.",dune part visual stun yet somewhat disjoint cinemat experi villeneuv direct undeni ambiti signatur style breathtak visual full display dune the black white scene reminisc archiv footag fascist germani particularli strike add uniqu aesthet storytel howev overal pace edit film leav someth desir the narr flow often disrupt abrupt cut seemingli unconnect scene it appear abund materi shot process trim manag length may challeng one despit effort film still clock lengthi hour minut the plot dune part bear resembl tv seri game throne complex polit machin war faction power struggl howev film storytel fall short comparison depth intricaci hbo seri the limit runtim theatric releas may constrain filmmak abil fulli explor rich sourc materi perhap televis adapt would suitabl format delv nuanc dune univers charact in term perform austin butler portray feydrautha standout butler bring magnet presenc charisma role overshadow even lead actor timoth chalamet play paul atreid chalamet struggl match intens allur butler feydrautha perform mere shadow comparison overal dune part film aspir great fall short execut the visual spectacl moment brillianc undeni disjoint narr uneven pace prevent fulli realiz potenti
"First of all, part one was pretty good, fast pace some talking , but not much, a fast pace movie I enjoyed, overall a very good movie.

The overall part 2 is boring not the actors fault though, rather it's the script that is dragging its feet nowhere because it's badly written so bad it becomes a snooze, at the end of the day it's boring and we've lost interest. Characters spend some much time talking philosophizing whining and complaining you wonder why a production would spend millions on such a badly written boring story. That's the trend these days, when a network wants to cut down expenses it's making characters blob to death.

Chalamet not my cup of tea in this part 2, he looks out of place, feels more like a choir boy rather than an action movie hero.

"""Dune: Part 1"" and ""Dune: Part 2"" are films that define what sci-fi should be - an epic with a grand scale and an incredible story.

I love Herbert's novel and until Villeneuve's films, I believed that this was the type of story that could not be translated into a picture. Jesus, how wrong I was! It's an absolute masterpiece and something that lives in you. Some may be turned off by the fact that the entire film is based mainly on dialogues and building relationships, but I am sure that for those few, including myself, it will be a masterpiece on par with Star Wars for our fathers. This is what genre cinema should look like, not robots saving the galaxy and women in tight leggings jumping on buildings (yes, I'm talking about you Marvel)

"""Dune: Part Two"" (2024), directed by the masterful Denis Villeneuve, stands as a remarkable sequel that not only lives up to but surpasses its predecessor. Much like the celebrated sequels ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2003), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), this film elevates the franchise to new heights.

Villeneuve's atmospheric and deliberately paced direction, complemented by Hans Zimmer's enigmatic score, creates an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning. The vast, sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giant-worm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape, leaving audiences mesmerized throughout.

The introduction of Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence, while the demise of the Harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate, avoiding simplicity. The film culminates in an epic duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha, delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusion.

Timothée Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides, the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen. The narrative remains faithful to Frank Herbert's novel, capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that ""the war has just begun.""

While the novel doesn't extend to a Part Three, the expansive universe of Dune offers numerous sequels in the books. With the right efforts and approvals, there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future. For now, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen, and I eagerly anticipate experiencing it again, this time with my beloved by my side.",dune part two direct master deni villeneuv stand remark sequel live surpass predecessor much like celebr sequel the fellowship ring the dark knight the bourn ultimatum film elev franchis new height villeneuv atmospher deliber pace direct complement han zimmer enigmat score creat immers experi captiv begin the vast sweep dune sand breathtak scene giantworm ride travers expans desert landscap leav audienc mesmer throughout the introduct austin butler feydrautha add compel layer malevol demis harkonnen leader satisfyingli intric avoid simplic the film culmin epic duel paul atreid feydrautha deliv elegantli craft thrill conclus timoth chalamet perform paul atreid prophesi lisan algaib noth short extraordinari hi portray chosen leader captiv becom imposs look away screen the narr remain faith frank herbert novel captur essenc epic tale hint war begun while novel doesnt extend part three expans univers dune offer numer sequel book with right effort approv hope cinemat adapt futur for dune part two monument achiev demand seen i eagerli anticip experienc time belov side
"Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.

Dune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.

This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.

Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.

There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.

Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.

Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timothée Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen ""jihad messiah"" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timothée Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.

However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.

Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.

Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the ""epicness"" ""darkness"" and sense of ""doom"" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.

Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.

Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.

"I see quite a lot of positive reviews here from younger audiences. It seems dune struck a cord in all born after 2000. Which I guess is a good thing. Calling it the best movie of all time is something else. It means you first have to watch all films of all time to make such a bold assessment. And secondly Villeneuves rendering needs to be something special. It is not.

There has been other and better movies displaying the same story line, scenes and composition. Sorry to disappoint you Gen-Zers or below.

Even Frank Herbert confest himself to be inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. Now this film is one you need to see (no sand worms there unfortunately)

The story-arch and intrigues are also not new. Even cliche. The high-rise hero falling for the lowly dame and ultimately dump her? Nothing new (but Dune 5 will show something different) Apart from the well orchestrated mass fight and one on one fight scenes we have seen way to often this movie has very little to offer. There really is no suprise only quite a lot of wasted talent on Rampling and Walker (those are boomers btw) There is no surprise, no novelty in this movie. It is a boring arrangement of boring repeats. Even Hans went back to a repetition of what we have heard (before Interstallar, that was truy awesome)

If you want to see a movie in the desert go watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see a messias go watch Matrix.

"Dune: Part 2"" is an exceptional continuation of the epic saga that left audiences eagerly anticipating more. From the very start, the film captivates with its breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling, transporting viewers to the mystical and dangerous world of Arrakis.

The plot is filled with intense moments and unexpected twists, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The character development is deep and compelling, with performances that bring depth and nuance to the iconic figures of the Dune universe.

One of the standout elements of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its otherworldly soundtrack. The music, composed by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the grand scale of the film, enhancing the emotional and dramatic impact of each scene. It's a sonic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

Overall, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a cinematic triumph. It's a masterful blend of action, drama, and science fiction, delivering an immersive and unforgettable experience.

"Where do I bring, well this movie is not good. Everyone heaping praise on it must be drunk or so starved for anything that looks good that they'll just blindly nod and smile.

It's slow and I don't mean regular slow, I mean Zak Snyder super slow. If you're going to make a movie three hours long, fill it will interesting characters a d good dialogue. Don't just fill it with scenes that add nothing to the story.

Secondly, and this is my biggest gripe. Why do Timothee and Zendaya sounds the like they're a couple of Californian kids there for spring break. Paul's mum doesn't even bother hiding her British accent, Javier is the only one putting in any effort to sound like an indigenous population.

Plot holes, so many plot holes. In the beginning Paul's mum magically transports to kill someone about to kill Paul, how?

The freemen attack the harkonnen and no the ship has guns, Zendaya has a gun but everyone else sword fights for some reason.

Paul rides a worm, worm could at any moment dive deep and the rider is dead. This is some of the stupidest writing I have ever read.

Chemistry, Zendaya and Timothee don't have any

Visuals, amazing the movie looks incredible which is why I imagine everyone is gushing over it.

"Unlike Dune Part 1, the wonderful other-worldly music in Dune Part 2 didn't drown out the soft-spoken dialogues. That said, by the sparse music soundtrack, my hunch is the producers, director, and music editors went too far in the other direction.

Dune Part 2 continued the same awe-inspiring cinematography and breath-taking visual effects. However, its sometimes-mundane script and pedestrian storyline was held together by a superior, solid acting and editing. The costuming was, for the most part, magnificent. However, in a couple of battle scenes, the nearly identical battle garb made it very difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. But the scenes of the good guys riding atop the gigantic desert worms was absolutely thrilling! Wound I recommend watching Dune Part 2?

"The only reason I liked Dune Part 1 a little better is just because of the storyline. Part 2 was largely about the aftermath of Part 1 and the build-up to an epic Holy War. So there was nothing that was done any worse, I just liked the character development in Part 1 and how they set everything up.

It's beautifully shot and the cinematography is incredible. Also how it implements sound, and silence, to sculpt the atmosphere is awesome too. The special effects I thought were insane too, just with the scope of the machines, sandworms, explosions, and the angles they used.

"Dune Part Two: Interestingly Compelling

Religion can be a controversial topic, some (like me) believe in it, and others do not. With so many people believing different things, and so many religions in the world, it can be hard to make a movie around this topic. It is not impossible however, since other shows have done it, such as His Dark Materials, Lucifer, and Dune. Dune Part One and Two is directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya from Spiderman the Homecoming Trilogy.

Paul Atreides (Chalamet) is now with the Fremen people, trying to fulfill the prophecy. Paul also wants revenge on Baron Harkonnen, who killed his father. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens want to take over the desert (Arrakis) from the Fremen.

Dune Part Two is a movie with lots of action, people riding cool creatures, and has incredible acting. What makes this movie so compelling is the religious aspect. Chalamet is compelling when portraying Paul, someone who at first did not believe the prophecy, but soon learns his purpose in life. From part one he grows into a good fighter, and someone who people wanted to follow. Zendaya portrays Chani, one of the Fremen people. By the end, I felt bad for her since she was alone. However, she stuck to her beliefs, even when everyone else decided to go in a different direction. Zendaya does an excellent job at playing someone that does not believe in the prophecy but cares about Paul. I enjoy seeing Zendaya expand her horizons, going from a love interest in a superhero movie, to a love interest and a strong warrior in a drama. Rebecca Ferguson played Paul's mother (Lady Jessica), who was the first one who wanted her son to fulfill the prophecy. She is a part of the Bene Gesserit (a religious sisterhood). Her main goal is to train her son to become who she thinks he will be. Austin Butler is the nephew of the guy in charge of house Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha likes to kill people for fun and is a good fighter. The relationship between the two houses (Atreides and Harkonnens) is complicated, which makes the audience want to know what is going to happen.

Unfortunately, no one taught me anything about religion when I was younger. My first Introduction to it was watching the show Lucifer (which I think is sad). This is why I think making movies with religious meaning behind them is a wonderful thing to do. I have had a hard year (with death and sickness in my family), and religion has somehow become a topic I like to discuss. Therefore, this is why I found Dune Part Two better than Part One, the religious aspect made the movie more interesting and compelling to watch.",dune part two interestingli compel religion controversi topic like believ other with mani peopl believ differ thing mani religion world hard make movi around topic it imposs howev sinc show done hi dark materi lucif dune dune part one two direct deni villeneuv star timothe chalamet zendaya spiderman homecom trilog paul atreid chalamet fremen peopl tri fulfil propheci paul also want reveng baron harkonnen kill father meanwhil harkonnen want take desert arraki fremen dune part two movi lot action peopl ride cool creatur incred act what make movi compel religi aspect chalamet compel portray paul someon first believ propheci soon learn purpos life from part one grow good fighter someon peopl want follow zendaya portray chani one fremen peopl by end i felt bad sinc alon howev stuck belief even everyon el decid go differ direct zendaya excel job play someon believ propheci care paul i enjoy see zendaya expand horizon go love interest superhero movi love interest strong warrior drama rebecca ferguson play paul mother ladi jessica first one want son fulfil propheci she part bene gesserit religi sisterhood her main goal train son becom think austin butler nephew guy charg hous harkonnen feydrautha like kill peopl fun good fighter the relationship two hous atreid harkonnen complic make audienc want know go happen unfortun one taught anyth religion i younger my first introduct watch show lucif i think sad thi i think make movi religi mean behind wonder thing i hard year death sick famili religion somehow becom topic i like discus therefor i found dune part two better part one religi aspect made movi interest compel watch
"This movie is visually well done, for 80% of it shot in the bright sun of a desert. The sound is also great, but I wouldn't call it music so much as tones. It fits though. More like something seen in a t.v. Show then the epic music that Danny Elfman or John Williams bring.

The writers really didn't read the books, did they? Like the first film but even worse, this was a child's Cliff Notes version of the actually books. To know the storyline you'd have to have read the books or watched the previous, superior versions. Chani is especially poorly done and again the characters are mostly just long gazes.

I understand the simpletons who enjoyed the visuals. This movie has made a good deal of money but there's a reason it won't ever reach a billion mark like truly epic films. And the IMDB meter on this will probably drop closer to my score as non-fanatics see this film over the coming years. Again, the 3-part Frank Herbert miniseries is the best, the 1984 is the classic nostalgia and this one looks pretty but says very little.",thi movi visual well done shot bright sun desert the sound also great i wouldnt call music much tone it fit though more like someth seen tv show epic music danni elfman john william bring the writer realli didnt read book like first film even wors child cliff note version actual book to know storylin youd read book watch previou superior version chani especi poorli done charact mostli long gaze i understand simpleton enjoy visual thi movi made good deal money there reason wont ever reach billion mark like truli epic film and imdb meter probabl drop closer score nonfanat see film come year again part frank herbert miniseri best classic nostalgia one look pretti say littl
"Dune: Part Two is about Paul Atreides's self-doubt of himself being the Messiah of Fremen and his desire to take revenge on his Father's murder and extermination of his house, contrary to his father's view on revenge.

This movie dwelled mostly on Paul exploring whether he needed to be the Messiah of the Fremen or not, but that made his revolt plot against the emperor look underwhelming. Chani loves and helps Paul for his dedication to knowing the ways of Fremen but she envies him that he is the Messiah as most Fremen expect to be. That's a contradiction to be within one character. Feyd-Rautha tried to be badass in his introduction scene, but it failed instead making him look like a puny who thinks of himself as badass. There is no weight in this character: The Worst Villain portrayal.

Now, I am interested and delved into what Paul will do to the Bene Gesserit for the game they played with his houses and turning other houses against him in the name of Prophecies. As they are the actual villains, convincing the emperor to slay the House Atredies. They are getting ready to accept and adapt themselves to whoever will win the emperor. By marrying the emperor's daughter to a new emperor, they will make sure that they exist after the Holy War.

As the movie is slow-paced while watching for the first time I paid full attention without getting bored, but the second time I got bored mostly, especially with the scenes I felt as drawbacks.

The actors did a great job, especially Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. The director built the world amazingly. He focused more on how Paul Atreides evolved in the dilemma of being a Messiah or being a part of Fremen's revolution. The cinematography was good as it captured the dune desert in a stunning way and amazing shots on the Worm riding scenes. Dialogues and giving meaning to characters' names as the prophecy describes them were a good touch to the movie. The music and Sound effects were great and not more or less than the scenes required.

Overall my opinion is that it's a good movie but with some flaws as I mentioned and it had more story and character depth than Dune: Part One. I would definitely recommend this movie. If you enjoy the movies in which the story happens in a completely fictional world or universe, then you'll enjoy this movie and its prequel.

My only issue with the film was that, in my opinion, the pacing was a bit off.

"It seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact. But Dune Part II left me wanting more. I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth.

"Denis Villeneuve continues to provide strong direction, writing and atmospheres throughout this movie as Villeneuve perfectly captures the characters, essence and themes of Dune. The camerawork, the visuals, the colors and production designs are all fantastic as it helped create the world and settings within the characters and tone. Various scenes of action, thrills, and tension were all well-executed and done beautifully. With many all-star cast members, all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place.

Since I haven't read the original book yet, I may not be too familiar with the lore of Dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts, characters and themes explored are pretty good. Including a great soundtrack, uses of dialogue and structures throughout. I honestly don't have any complaints about this one because I was enthralled with the entire movie.

"Villeneuve wanted this movie to stand on its two feet, will still being a continuation of the last film. It delivers on both fronts. The quality of the shots, acting, pacing is still there from the last movie. You can put both parts together as one movie and it would work. The dream sequences were not as impactful as they were in the last movie, and almost non existent when Paul is enlightened by prescience. If we were to look through his mind like it was in the book, the message of the danger of charismatic leaders might have been less impactful.

With only a few flaws and nitpicks, Dune Part 2 is worthy of a watch.",villeneuv want movi stand two foot still continu last film it deliv front the qualiti shot act pace still last movi you put part togeth one movi would work the dream sequenc impact last movi almost non exist paul enlighten prescienc if look mind like book messag danger charismat leader might less impact with flaw nitpick dune part worthi watch
"The storyline was so powerful and wasn't dragged out like it was a bit with the first one. Here every scene felt so important and the dialogue is so impactful and inspiring!

Character development can sometimes be a bit tricky with movies who are dealing with a lot of characters yet here they handled it wonderful! The main and supporting characters each had something to bring to the table!

"I watched Dune 2 on Netflix.

It's nearly 3 hours long. Oy vey.

I did see the first one but forgot almost everything about it other than who the star is. Oh and I remembered the fact that as I recall you never get to see the worms and that disappointed me.

In this one you do. Yay.

I read the book years and years ago, of course. I'm not sure I liked it all that much because I had trouble understanding it. You know... following the story. That carried over to the movie. I was pretty much lost during much of the movie... just sitting there hoping the pieces would fall into place (they didn't)

Things would happen like Paul was being tested at one point by being sent alone into the desert and then it quickly cuts away to him being like The Prophet and mobbed by people and I was left wondering what the heck happened. It was like bad scripting or bad editing or something.

Visually it is amazing although I got tired of all the endless shots of Chalamet's skinny stick legs. It is tho really beautiful - almost Lawrence of Arabia beautiful. Gorgeous desert scenes, and the worms are cool (in a theater on a big screen I bet they were terrifying and gross).

But in the end it is disjointed and too long.

So.. five out of ten stars. No firm recommendation here.",i watch dune netflix it nearli hour long oy vey i see first one forgot almost everyth star oh i rememb fact i recal never get see worm disappoint in one yay i read book year year ago cours im sure i like much i troubl understand you know follow stori that carri movi i pretti much lost much movi sit hope piec would fall place didnt thing would happen like paul test one point sent alon desert quickli cut away like the prophet mob peopl i left wonder heck happen it like bad script bad edit someth visual amaz although i got tire endless shot chalamet skinni stick leg it tho realli beauti almost lawrenc arabia beauti gorgeou desert scene worm cool theater big screen i bet terrifi gross but end disjoint long so five ten star no firm recommend
"Rating: 9.5/10 Watched on Feb 25th, 2024 @ Fan First Premiere event Format: (Digital) IMAX

It's safe to say that Dune Part 2 is basically an expansion of Part One. More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.

However, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.

Director Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.

The VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.

The film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.

Hans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.

Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timothée Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.

For the negativities:

-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.

-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?

Also, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.

-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE) Lastly, in case you didn't know, during the London premiere of Dune Part Two, actress Anya Taylor-Joy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film. Can I understand why this was announced and why wasn't it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time????? Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere? This makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years.",rate watch feb th fan first premier event format digit imax it safe say dune part basic expans part one more charact ad stori complex x interest much go world dune bigger howev lot neg opinion posit much stronger ruin experi lower rate director deni villeneuv prove part two perfect director direct dune project in addit crew help deliv project truli accur amaz job deliv world way suppos deliv the vfx film absolut amaz notic expect scene obviou use green screen ruin experi also cinematographi captur arraki film held absolut support vfx captur great shot long wide shot captur beauti desert moreov time charact posit middl long wide shot captur size charact compar world around mostli show vulner strong abil depend charact the film much inspir middl eastern cultur term languag cloth product design movement belief charact follow han zimmer music perfectli compos realli love fight sequenc music play background make whole attent point toward fight movement increas nervous ten vibe timoth chalamet zendaya absolut amaz paul atreid play timoth chalamet reach peak prime level by end film longer young paul atreid power man arraki one top control he written much care make recal version saw part one long journey experienc wasnt easi and might one greatest charact studiescharact develop stori cinema histori timoth chalamet huge part achiev by end part two realiz chalamet inde perfect actor portray paul atreid due chalamet deep portray differ stage charact goe film mostli moment anger strength charact howev real surpris rebecca ferguson charact realli went mani chang film realli shown due rebecca act she absolut abl deliv terrifi power characterist charact jessica the second biggest surpris austin butler fyedrautha makeup design act abl bring charact screen way suppos book for neg with mistak dune part one part two whole dune saga highli need rate r allow gore bloodi disgust violenc scene present film part two perfect chanc due amount fight sequenc specif austin butler charact feydrautha epic fight sequenc shot black white i think obviou reason behind shoot black white unfortun serious film lower significantli especi javier bardem charact stilgar crack joke what happen stolgar walk oscar isaac duke leto atrediu part one much confid serious refus give anyth peopl also dave batista charact glossu rabban weak film bare saw defend even power someth fit batista physic appear charact characterist brutal hous harkonnen repres not a spoiler a it wa announc by director deni villeneuv lastli case didnt know london premier dune part two actress anya taylorjoy appear red carpet announc actress small surpris appear role film can i understand announc wasnt kept surpris like whole time sinc actor actress surpris role film appear red carpet premier thi make appear carpet much useless truli ruin surpris kept hidden perfectli past year
"I think most the ppl who claim dune to be the masterpiece are not familiar with cinematography at all. Perhaps they are young generation ppl who missed real masterpieces of the past, when acting, dialogues and story telling were the most important aspects of the movie. Not just flashy special effects like we have nowadays in movie and music industry. I really liked the first part but it was still far from a masterpiece , the second part I rate even lower. Both are good and entertaining movies but acting and story telling is not there to even consider a good 8/10. The highest notes go to the scenography and music. Very well done.",i think ppl claim dune masterpiec familiar cinematographi perhap young gener ppl miss real masterpiec past act dialogu stori tell import aspect movi not flashi special effect like nowaday movi music industri i realli like first part still far masterpiec second part i rate even lower both good entertain movi act stori tell even consid good the highest note go scenographi music veri well done
"Just got out of an early screening in IMAX 70mm and it was amazing. The visuals and CGI in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than Dune Part 1 even. A lot happens in this movie story-wise and the pacing was very good. Denis Villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning. The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way. Overall, the movie was fantastic, a must-watch, and I HIGHLY recommend watching it in IMAX.",just got earli screen imax mm amaz the visual cgi film excel cinematograph better dune part even a lot happen movi storywis pace good deni villeneuv use beauti filmmak techniqu end result stun the contrast one black white scene rest movi color brilliant move realli leav audienc mouth hang hair stand suspens there mani twistssurpris stori execut flawlessli i never felt bore movi the action scene swordknif fight scene also well choreograph definit refresh see thi movi much better dune part term stori cinematographi cgi everyth el movi definit set dune perfect way overal movi fantast mustwatch i highli recommend watch imax

"Dune is very close to the category of masterpiece. Specialists in the field such as Steven Spielberg or Christopher Nolan have already said it and hey will not put their credibility at stake.

I have read that there are various fandoms of much simpler universes with less talented creators who are condemning the film simply out of resentment. Or simply people without artistic sensitivity.

You can deny it. If you watched in the cinema, when you got up from your seat, you felt like you've just come from an exciting ride on a sandworm. All my senses were excited. Dune 2 is a delight in every department, and Timothée's transformation in this film is something we haven't seen from him yet. The strength, the range of variety and scope really surprised me. Austin Butler steals the show, and establishes himself as a solid actor in the industry. Rebecca Ferguson shows that she is at her peak. And Dennis

Villeneuve is established as one of the 5 directors of this century. In a single film, he manages to handle several rhythms to an almost perfect level. The last hour of the film is a scary adrenaline rush. The opening sequence is a feast for the eyes and the scene of Paul riding the Sandworm is magical.

"All the complaints about short fight scenes and characters not getting proper shine, or plots not explained are foolishness . The reason this movie is so significant is because it wasn't scared to tell a story in an untraditional way. I find it funny that everyone says "" it's much better than the first, I hated the first movie it was too slow"" . So why the heck did you watch the second movie? Seems like most people feel this movie directly threatened Star Wars so they chose to pick sides no matter what brilliance they watched. Part of what makes Dune so unique is the fact that they don't explain every little thing to you like you were a child. But most people like their hands held . We need more movies like this and less movies from Disney/Marvel/Starwars with predictable outcomes and setups we have seen for decades.

"There are a few films that define the time. I had Star Wars trilogy as a kid, my first son had LOTR, the second had Harry Potter... and then for while it seemed like we were left with unending marvel tripe, embarrassing butchering of Star Wars franchise and shallow remakes of, well... everything.

And now, finally, I can say that my third son has a movie for his generation. Beautiful, complex, thought-provoking and epic. The movie that can extend his world into a fantasy realm that's not about wearing latex and shooting everything that moves. It's movie where nuance is discovered through many conversations with friends and lessons learned through experiencing the real world with the new lens.

I was expecting this one to be better. It wasn't The characters are simple and naive. The story isn't deep.

"THE 2 FILMS ARE... just OK.

Public sentiment is against me but here goes why.

Pluses: great FX, plot follows the trilogy, all the big cinematic boxes are ticked, fair pacing (more on that later), some characters are well played.

Negatives: waaaay over-acted and I felt like I was watching a 40's B movie, antagonists far too obvious and shallow, Paul was borderline good at best, the battles were poorly choreographed - a lot of slashing and posturing reminiscent of ""300"" and that's not a compliment - the whole dreaming and mind talking thing wasn't impactful enough, Christopher Walken is one of my favorite actors but this time he was flat - maybe he was poorly directed? - pacing was too slow with lots of walking and walking and climbing and sand dancing - cutting all that out would've saved a least a half hour of screen time and it felt like filler to me.

Yeah it did huge box office but to me that's more of an indicator of the general dumbing down of society at large, and less (a lot less) than it being a great film.",the film are ok public sentiment goe pluse great fx plot follow trilog big cinemat box tick fair pace later charact well play neg waaaay overact i felt like i watch b movi antagonist far obviou shallow paul borderlin good best battl poorli choreograph lot slash postur reminisc that compliment whole dream mind talk thing wasnt impact enough christoph walken one favorit actor time flat mayb poorli direct pace slow lot walk walk climb sand danc cut wouldv save least half hour screen time felt like filler yeah huge box offic that indic gener dumb societi larg less lot less great film

"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, given the great story and masterful execution. There were some changes from the books, but they were modest in scope and actually seemed like smart decisions -- that's kind of amazing all by itself.

Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, Léa Seydoux, and IMHO even Christopher Walken were all well-chosen for their roles. I appreciate good casting.

I happen to have read the books, which I thought were so-so (unlike my friends), so I don't understand the reviews whining about the movie being disappointing. The story and specific effects are top-notch. The experience is highly immersive. What else do you need?

I give this seven stars, plus a one-star bonus for the excellent adaption, a half-star bonus for the perfect pacing, and quarter-star bonuses for Javier Bardem and Florence Pugh*, whose performances I particularly enjoyed. That's nine (9) stars total.

* She didn't get much screen time, true, but I thought she was great. She seemed a tiny bit awkward and/or uncomfortable, which (for me) is just part of her realism and stage presence.

"A fan of Dune should absolutely read the books. The rich tapestry of details and stories present in the novels are often missing or condensed in the film adaptations. The depth of world-building and character development in Frank Herbert's work transports readers to an expansive and immersive universe that the movies can only hint at.

However, my current rating of the Dune movie takes into account the overall quality of films released in recent years. Compared to the many lackluster movies that have flooded the market, Dune stands out for its ambition, visual splendor, and attempt to faithfully capture the essence of Herbert's vision, even if it inevitably falls short of the book's depth.",a fan dune absolut read book the rich tapestri detail stori present novel often miss condens film adapt the depth worldbuild charact develop frank herbert work transport reader expans immers univers movi hint howev current rate dune movi take account overal qualiti film releas recent year compar mani lacklust movi flood market dune stand ambit visual splendor attempt faith captur essenc herbert vision even inevit fall short book depth

"The story in ""Dune: Part Two"" picks up right where the first film left off. Though the two projects were filmed separately, there is a singular vision and story arc between them. Writer/Director, Denis Villeneuve, is becoming a true powerhouse in Sci-Fi cinema, with ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" in his filmography. This movie is no different, as it is truly a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.

Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films that I have ever seen. There were multiple scenes that left me in awe, from the ambitious world-building and use of color. Similarly, the score by Hans Zimmer is compelling and mighty. The man composed the score for ""The Lion King"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Gladiator"", and this might be his best work. Pairing the visuals with the score makes this film feel larger than life, which makes Villeneuve's attention to characters so significant.

The character of Paul Atreides should be studied for years to come. His growth and development over these two films is beautifully executed, and the other characters are no different. As his eyes change color and he embraces his destiny, there is a confident maturity that transcends the screen. Timothee Chalamet puts forth the best performance of his career and many others, including Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"") and Zendaya follow suit.

This isn't much of a negative, but the first film is a must-watch if you are going to enjoy and understand ""Dune: Part II"". The story is full of complicated titles, planets, and prophecies. From the Bene Gesserit and the Lisan al Gaib to the Harkonnens, there is a lot to digest. Watching the first film with subtitles is almost a prerequisite.

Masterpiece. That is the best word to describe the powerful achievement of ""Dune: Part Two"". In every way, this movie builds on the first installment and feels larger than life. In my opinion, it is the best film released in the last five years (maybe even ten) and one of the most epic films I have seen on the big screen. If you have the chance, go to the theater to see it, you will not be disappointed.

Best Character: Muad'Dib Best Quote: ""Lead them to paradise"" - Paul Best Scene: Riding the worm.

Best Piece of Score: ""Kiss the Ring""

Note: I usually don't enjoy Javier Bardem's work, but he did great in this.

"Denis Villeneuve delivers nothing short of a monumental achievement in science-fiction filmmaking, and the best adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune up to date. The world is captivating, the visual effects and the production design are flawless. Greig Fraser's breath taking Cinematography, accompanied by Zimmer's sumptuous musical score bring you into the story of the madness of conquest and the power of belief.

Filled with breathtaking images, stunning action, it's a story that transcends it's genre. A story that is dense as the world of Dune remains intriguingly complex, full of characters whose roles shift and evolve. And even if it may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life, two films in, Chalamet's evolution as Paul gives everything a center. His subdued yet compelling performance serves the thematic ambiguity of Paul's character well. Zendaya gets more screen time then in the first film, but for me the standout performance came from Rebecca Ferguson. During this film I truly understood why she was best cast for this role. Javier Bardem further enriches the ensemble cast.

The best new addition to the crew is Austin Butler as the baron's bald-pated, hyper vicious nephew. As for Florence Pugh, even if her character is only getting a certain amount of screen time amidst Dune: Part Two's cast of returning characters, her impact could not be seen as minimal, setting the scene for further character development. Other newer characters like Lady Margot remain a bit more unexplored.

In our age of ever-increasing runtimes, it's a rare achievement that the film's 166-minute length feels really earned. But I do wish it had even more EVEN MORE run time, to allow more time for the most uncomfortable emotions to linger on in some scenes.

Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a grand entertainment that also sustains the main ideas of Frank Herbert's novel, exploring the dark aspects around religion, politics, power and violence. Absolute sensory overload. This must be seen on the biggest screen possible, with IMAX being almost like a chief's kiss. If Dune: Part 1 didn't make you a believer; Part 2 just might.

"I think that watching this film in a regular theatre or on TV must be a very different experience than what I had watching it in IMAX, in fact I've only ever seen Dune (both parts) in IMAX, so I can't really judge the movie in any other format. However, the crushing sense of scale is so important for the feeling you get from this (and the previous entry) that I really can't imagine the same effect from watching it on your phone or something. So, do see it on the largest, loudest screen you can find.

With that out of the way let's get to the film proper. At nearly 3 hours long, I could have easily sat on my chair for double that time and still not be bored. The second instalment of Dune is a miracle in several ways, a miracle of special effects, set and costume design and of storytelling, that manages to make a famously unwieldy story perfectly easy to parse, but it is above all a miracle of pacing. There isn't a second of boredom or a low point in the movie, it's an epic in the true sense of the term, you spend half the time crushed by scale and the other half lost in the details of the movie.

Managing to tell a complex political tale with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue or exposition, the film also makes several very smart changes to the book which I really want to see pay off in the third movie (there will be one, as this ends in a cliffhanger). In terms of acting everyone is pretty good, but the addition of Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the real standout here. Florence Pugh is promising but has a limited role, which if this is anything like the books will be greatly extended in the third movie. A real masterpiece.",i think watch film regular theatr tv must differ experi i watch imax fact ive ever seen dune part imax i cant realli judg movi format howev crush sen scale import feel get previou entri i realli cant imagin effect watch phone someth so see largest loudest screen find with way let get film proper at nearli hour long i could easili sat chair doubl time still bore the second instal dune miracl sever way miracl special effect set costum design storytel manag make famous unwieldi stori perfectli easi par miracl pace there isnt second boredom low point movi epic true sen term spend half time crush scale half lost detail movi manag tell complex polit tale surprisingli small amount dialogu exposit film also make sever smart chang book i realli want see pay third movi one end cliffhang in term act everyon pretti good addit austin butler psychot feydrautha harkonnen real standout florenc pugh promis limit role anyth like book greatli extend third movi a real masterpiec
"An absolutely gorgeous, austere piece of film. Denis Villeneuve is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images we've seen on the 21st century cinema screen. It's impossible to say this a bad film or adaptation.

Villeneuve treats each shot as if it were a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.

Herbert's dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader, who can't tell a Sandworm from a Sardaukar - which is one of the reasons Villeneuve's approach felt like such a breakthrough: It pared the mythology down to something manageable, serving up visceral action set-pieces at regular intervals. The movie air-dropped audiences in a world where foreign customs, politics and technology had long been established, never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytelling.

That's not to say Villeneuve's ""Dune"" movies are fast-paced. Channeling the austerity of Andrei Tarkovsky at times, the director takes nearly five hours to cover what David Lynch did in just slightly more than two (though iconic in some respects, the now badly dated 1984 version barely scratched the surface of Herbert's concerns). If ""Part Two"" feels slow in places, it's because Villeneuve takes time to develop the connection between characters, as in a handful of scenes dedicated to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and Paul, aka Muad'Dib (or Usul), whose undeniable attraction doesn't align with Jessica's plans for her son.

In many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first (pacing overall felt better, obviously less setup, the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe). But still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space. Some beats that need to feel pivotal, felt rushed to me and there's not much room for character performance to do the heavy lifting. You hardly notice though because you're inside a such stunningly realized alien landscape for the length, with so much to look at and take in. I enjoyed every moment and can't wait to revisit it soon.

Audience will find in Villeneuve's multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer. It's an enormous gamble, given the expense of creating at this scale, and a vote of confidence in cinema, which still hasn't recovered to the pre-pandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived. The fate of far more than Arrakis is riding on ""Dune.""",an absolut gorgeou auster piec film deni villeneuv serv majest scientif fiction imag weve seen st centuri cinema screen it imposs say bad film adapt villeneuv treat shot paint everi design choic seem hand millennium altern human histori arcan hieroglyph slew creativ mask veil meant conceal face manipul lever power nearli woman herbert den novel daunt slog averag reader cant tell sandworm sardaukar one reason villeneuv approach felt like breakthrough it pare mytholog someth manag serv viscer action setpiec regular interv the movi airdrop audienc world foreign custom polit technolog long establish never let complex element slow storytel that say villeneuv dune movi fastpac channel auster andrei tarkovski time director take nearli five hour cover david lynch slightli two though icon respect badli date version bare scratch surfac herbert concern if part two feel slow place villeneuv take time develop connect charact hand scene dedic fremen warrior chani zendaya paul aka muaddib usul whose undeni attract doesnt align jessica plan son in mani way overcom weak first pace overal felt better obvious less setup score use sparingli way allow mani moment breath but still suffer necess cram much stori small space some beat need feel pivot felt rush there much room charact perform heavi lift you hardli notic though your insid stunningli realiz alien landscap length much look take i enjoy everi moment cant wait revisit soon audienc find villeneuv multipart saga satisfact film offer it enorm gambl given expens creat scale vote confid cinema still hasnt recov prepandem level play franchis conceiv the fate far arraki ride dune

I can not wait for Dune 3 to get out. Can't imagine how can Denis Villenueve improve this movie. Actors performances were out of this world, really liked Chalamet, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh out there. They were giving their all.

"This isn't Dune. Events, characters are missing or changed for the worse. The plot is dumbed down really hard. Dialogues are on the level of children.

Not-Chani and Not-Paul don't have any chemistry together and they behave out of character just like most of the cast.

Major plot points were left out or changed which makes this a bad movie. Having nice visuals is not enough, you got to have a good script too.

It is disrespectful the call this visual diarrhea a Dune movie. Even the 1984 version was better, not to mention the 2000's mini series.

"Not only is Dune: Part Two one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, but it is also set to go down as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It brilliantly excels in and exceeds all of the aspects that made the first film so good, and truly represents modern filmmaking at its best.

The direction and screenplay are exceptional. Denis Villeneuve has done an incredible job adapting a book that many thought was impossible to film.

The score, cinematography, action sequences and visual effects establish the grand scale of this mesmerizing motion picture (Everything practically screams Academy Awards!), and the star cast is top-notch. Timothée Chalamet gives a formidable leading performance, Austin Butler portrays a compelling antagonist, and the rest of the cast is impressive, but the standout for me definitely was Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica (who I hope receives a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the upcoming Oscars).

I absolutely can't wait for Dune: Messiah!

"""Dune: Part Two"" delivers a breathtaking continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction masterpiece. This installment expands upon the intricate world-building, character development, and thematic depth established in the first film, solidifying its place as a landmark achievement in modern cinema.

Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of spectacular. The stunning cinematography, combined with the awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis, creates a sense of scale and grandeur that immerses viewers in the epic scope of the story. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that every frame is a work of art, capturing the harsh beauty and otherworldly nature of the desert planet.

The narrative picks up where the first film left off, following Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he embraces his destiny amidst political intrigue, betrayal, and the struggle for control over the spice-rich planet of Arrakis. Chalamet's performance is both nuanced and powerful, capturing Paul's transformation from a young nobleman to a leader of the Fremen.

The supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from Zendaya as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar. Their characters are given more depth and screen time, enriching the story and adding layers of complexity to the relationships and power dynamics at play.

The film's pacing is well-balanced, blending intense action sequences with quieter, character-driven moments. The epic battles and intricate political machinations are thrilling, while the exploration of themes such as destiny, loyalty, and survival adds emotional weight to the narrative.

Hans Zimmer's evocative score complements the film's visuals perfectly, enhancing the sense of wonder and tension throughout the story. The music underscores key moments with a haunting, otherworldly quality that lingers long after the credits roll.

While ""Dune: Part Two"" is a remarkable achievement, it is not without minor flaws. Some viewers may find the dense mythology and complex plot challenging to follow, particularly if they are not familiar with the source material. Additionally, the film's focus on world-building and thematic exploration occasionally comes at the expense of character development for some secondary characters.

Despite these minor issues, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation that elevates the epic saga to new heights. It honors the legacy of Herbert's novel while delivering a cinematic experience that is both visually stunning and intellectually engaging.

In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a triumph of filmmaking that solidifies Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as a definitive version of the classic story. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it stands as a monumental achievement in the science fiction genre and a must-see for fans of the epic saga.",dune part two deliv breathtak continu deni villeneuv ambiti adapt frank herbert scienc fiction masterpiec thi instal expand upon intric worldbuild charact develop themat depth establish first film solidifi place landmark achiev modern cinema visual dune part two noth short spectacular the stun cinematographi combin aweinspir landscap arraki creat sen scale grandeur immers viewer epic scope stori villeneuv meticul attent detail ensur everi frame work art captur harsh beauti otherworldli natur desert planet the narr pick first film left follow paul atreid timoth chalamet embrac destini amidst polit intrigu betray struggl control spicerich planet arraki chalamet perform nuanc power captur paul transform young nobleman leader fremen the support cast shine well standout perform zendaya chani rebecca ferguson ladi jessica javier bardem stilgar their charact given depth screen time enrich stori ad layer complex relationship power dynam play the film pace wellbalanc blend intens action sequenc quieter characterdriven moment the epic battl intric polit machin thrill explor theme destini loyalti surviv add emot weight narr han zimmer evoc score complement film visual perfectli enhanc sen wonder tension throughout stori the music underscor key moment haunt otherworldli qualiti linger long credit roll while dune part two remark achiev without minor flaw some viewer may find den mytholog complex plot challeng follow particularli familiar sourc materi addit film focu worldbuild themat explor occasion come expens charact develop secondari charact despit minor issu dune part two master continu elev epic saga new height it honor legaci herbert novel deliv cinemat experi visual stun intellectu engag in conclus dune part two triumph filmmak solidifi deni villeneuv adapt definit version classic stori with breathtak visual compel perform rich themat depth stand monument achiev scienc fiction genr mustse fan epic saga
"I am incredibly delighted after watching it!

I don't see any point in describing anything about the visuals, everything was clear from the first part, and Villeneuve in general is a great visionary, but I was happy to see that the script doesn't lag behind. The second part is also full of smart and unusual solutions, tricks and references. Zimmer's soundtrack is difficult to overestimate - it is magnificent, as always in projects of this level.

As for the plot, it is just as choppy as in the first part, but this cannot be avoided. At the same time, even at the end of the film, Villeneuve continues to introduce the inexperienced viewer to the universe of Frank Herbert, while hinting that he wants to finally take on the next book. I believe that Villeneuve understands the vision of the author of the books on the world and the future as no one else.

Movies, like books, demonstrate reality mercilessly, hard, dry, like the sands of a dune. Ruling with your heart is weakness, because you always have to make hard choices. Villeneuve also demonstrates how faith and religion are important for the world, how you can create confusion, fool the weak and hit the minds of fanatics without any instructions - just smart planning. For me, this part will be forever etched in my memory. I definitely recommend watching it to those who liked the first part.",i incred delight watch i dont see point describ anyth visual everyth clear first part villeneuv gener great visionari i happi see script doesnt lag behind the second part also full smart unusu solut trick refer zimmer soundtrack difficult overestim magnific alway project level a plot choppi first part cannot avoid at time even end film villeneuv continu introduc inexperienc viewer univers frank herbert hint want final take next book i believ villeneuv understand vision author book world futur one el movi like book demonstr realiti mercilessli hard dri like sand dune rule heart weak alway make hard choic villeneuv also demonstr faith religion import world creat confus fool weak hit mind fanat without instruct smart plan for part forev etch memori i definit recommend watch like first part
"Being a long time fan of Dune, and the books by Frank Herbert, I left Dune: Part Two with a sense of confusion at what I had just watched.

Denis Villeneuve did a phenomenal job with Dune: Part One, hands down, no question. He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.

Dune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a ""masterclass of filmmaking"" and ""best science fiction movie of all time to date"".

I am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.

So, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.

There are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by ""holy crap!"" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.

Had Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.

This is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.

I leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning. If you want to see an amazing movie, you will be pleased.

"The perception of this movie really depends on several factors: books read, Lynch's version watched, inclination to SF (and any combination thereto) or none of that. No one can deny that visuals in this movie are fantastic (including SFX), but what else there is? Some occasional acting (strictly routine, nothing enthusiastic), strange editing (at moments being nonsense - the short scene wit Paul drinking water of life), routine music (lately modern woman's voice screaming, or ""vocalizing"", as they like to say), bad writing, uneven pace, no science and a lot of fiction. If one wants great visuals with dense substance, right pacing, music, editing and direction (with occasional connection to the literary template by P. Dick), one should watch Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, for example. Dune has nothing to do with it. The books are too complex for a literal adaptation anyway. Second part has more substance than the first one, but stretched and lost in (too) long ""symbolic"" shots of everything else. Almost typical modern Hollywood. So, if you'e among first three mentioned categories - avoid disappointment. The rest might find it even great (although they cannot explain why).

"Having escaped the annihilation of his father's army by Imperial troops (relegated to the villainous Harkonnens), Paul Antreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a Bene Gesserit 'witch', join the Fremen, Arrakis' fearsome desert warriors. Due to the millennium-old Bene Gesserit program of spreading myths and prophecies throughout the universe, Paul is seen by many of the Fremen as the Messiah who was foretold to free their world and make the arid planet a paradise. Like 'Dune, part one', Denis Villeneuve's vision of Frank Herbert's popular book is very well done, especially the sets, props, and cinematography. The acting and script suffices for the relatively 'basic' main characters (Paul and Chani, Chalamet and Zendaya). Chalamet is fine when brooding or messing around with worms, but lacks something when trying to sound imperious and powerful, and Zendaya spends most of the film looking looking some combination of tough, suspicious and annoyed. The secondary characters are more interesting (IMO) especially Jessica and the Bene Gessarat Reverand Mothers, but like most villains, the Harkonnens are a bit over-done (but much less so than the hammy and cartoonish characters in David Lynch's 1984 lensing of the story). The only thing I disliked about the film were the inconsistencies in what would 'work' as a weapon in the Dune universe: in the book, 'shields' neutralised energy and fast-moving projectile weapons, so killing was done by blade, but slowly, so as to penetrate the shield; in the movie, energy weapons seem to be used when convienient and there's lots of flashy knife play but little to suggest that the shields were being defeated (and if no shields, why bother with knives (other than highly choreographed melees look really cool)). All in all, like part 1, part 2 is a well-made, entertaining version of a book considered unfilmable. I'm unsure whether to look forward (to or get my hopes up for) the next installment in the epic - I never liked the subsequent books in the series.",have escap annihil father armi imperi troop releg villain harkonnen paul antreid timoth chalamet mother ladi jessica rebecca ferguson bene gesserit witch join fremen arraki fearsom desert warrior due millenniumold bene gesserit program spread myth propheci throughout univers paul seen mani fremen messiah foretold free world make arid planet paradis like dune part one deni villeneuv vision frank herbert popular book well done especi set prop cinematographi the act script suffic rel basic main charact paul chani chalamet zendaya chalamet fine brood mess around worm lack someth tri sound imperi power zendaya spend film look look combin tough suspici annoy the secondari charact interest imo especi jessica bene gessarat reverand mother like villain harkonnen bit overdon much less hammi cartoonish charact david lynch lens stori the thing i dislik film inconsist would work weapon dune univers book shield neutralis energi fastmov projectil weapon kill done blade slowli penetr shield movi energi weapon seem use convieni there lot flashi knife play littl suggest shield defeat shield bother knive highli choreograph mele look realli cool all like part part wellmad entertain version book consid unfilm im unsur whether look forward get hope next instal epic i never like subsequ book seri

"I watched Dune 2 expecting a continuation of the interesting first part, but I left the theater in awe and noticed others leaving equally mesmerized and amazed. The film is a masterpiece. Visually stunning, with a compelling story featuring well-developed characters and excellent performances.

While the first film follows the ""hero's journey"" as we all know it, it left a taste of ""more of the same."" Dune 2, on the other hand, while still using this storytelling method, twists it in a way that washes away the slight taste of cliché from the first film. And the director executes this spectacularly. It's a ""must-watch"" for any sci-fi fan and undoubtedly one of the best in the genre of all time.

Today, I was impressed in the best possible way.

"The cinematography is really good and there's moments of the movie where you feel like you're in it. The action scenes are way better in this one as well as the storyline. However there are still some moments that don't keep you tuned in.

This film does provide more backstory about characters Austin Butler did a great job and deserved more screen time.

Timothee's delivery as a menacing character could be better but still decent.

The sound track is pretty nice and keeps you awake through a lengthy film as Dune.

Some aspects are predictable but it doesn't take away from the film.

"Dune 1 was novel, captivating and you started to form a connection with the characters. Sadly, this was lost in Dune 2. Whilst the cinematography and music were excellent, there was a whiff of an Art Malik movie about this - style over substance. There were some brilliant scenes and moments.

However, the plot lacked direction, was not all that compelling, characters lacked development and depth and the film was just too long, such that it was a slight relief when it ended. Such a shame. I think it has been overrated. I would recommend watching it, but go when well rested and feeling patient...",dune novel captiv start form connect charact sadli lost dune whilst cinematographi music excel whiff art malik movi style substanc there brilliant scene moment howev plot lack direct compel charact lack develop depth film long slight relief end such shame i think overr i would recommend watch go well rest feel patient
"First and foremost the movie is a masterpiece. The vast majority of the poor reviews come from hardcore book fans (disclaimer: I'm one) complaining about variations from the book. I won't elaborate on details to avoid spoilers but what needs to be understood is that it is a different media. Decisions were made by Villeneuve to suppress elements that are present on the book to allow a better flow of the story without compromising its main plotline. He has succeeded in my opinion. Including all the components of the book would inevitably lead to underdeveloped storylines. Another reason for one of his most criticized decisions is obviously technical. Yes, I'm talking about a certain key book character that ""appears"" in a different way in the movie. This character would have to be done in CGI or with an actor dubbing another. I believe both outcomes would be subpar in comparison with how it was handled.

For those who have not seen the movie (having read the books or not): go! Make sure you select the biggest available screen (I went for IMAX) and buckle up for the ride.

Because you either have no imagination or are just generally a negative human. This film has everything and is a modern day great.

"I just experienced an early access showing, and I have to say, it was mind-blowing. Seriously, do yourself a favor and catch it in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world-building, storytelling, score, action sequences, cinematography - you name it, it's all top-notch. Denis Villeneuve really outdid himself; it's like a masterclass in filmmaking. The casting choices were spot-on from start to finish, and the new additions just elevated everything. Timothee Chalamet nailed it as Paul Atreides - so believable, raw, and real. He owned that lead role. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin were all fantastic as usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continued to bring the evil vibes. Austin Butler stole the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken added a solid freshness to the cast.

In a nutshell, Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi masterpiece that seamlessly blends myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale.

"Dune part two is a very good movie. It is a masterpiece in terms of visuals, stage designs, use of sound, acting, and the subtext it adapts from the book. It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.

The film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.

The second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.

It's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.

Dune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time. I loved how they changed Chani's story arc and gave her a personality, and I loved how they showed Jessica's role more clearly than in the book. I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.

So, it is not free from some flaws. Still, it is such a good movie that, while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again, I love this movie even more by watching it over and over again.",dune part two good movi it masterpiec term visual stage design use sound act subtext adapt book it perhap best movi hollywood offer u recent year made qualifi peopl but flaw even though voic peopl tri say silenc due hype rage around still i also say deserv hype i ever seen the film two major issu relat the first end film rush budget screen time run the film move like jump scene scene without allow u enjoy final climax moment thu scari sardaukar saw first movi becom meaningless it bit like last season game throne pace problem honestli i suspect feel i enthus qualiti film end i went crazi see the second problem alia i understand difficulti stage alia that decid deviat book keep mother womb throughout movi thi refer spoil pace aspect movi smooth except last act while see paul jessica experi meaning spread timelin refer point forc happen five six month it problem shouldnt even mention fact fremen battl uniform resembl paul vision first movi made littl bitter dune masterpiec mani sen especi cinematograph in fact sourc stori say peopl subtext world fiction amaz i havent complet immers movi long time i love chang chani stori arc gave person i love show jessica role clearli book i love made charact feyd meaning place grand scheme thing so free flaw still good movi normal get bore watch movi i love movi even watch

"Saw the Dune ² film today.

Really enjoyed it and it had some good visuals.

Well worth seeing and I look forward to the inevitable pt3. But...... Disappointed the new films didn't utilise the Bene Gesserit 'Weirding Way' power, so no weaponised modules. 😢 the 'voice' is still used though of course.

I'm all for diversity. And given the books mirror on the worlds religions and politics this was fitting to have all cultures involved. But was there a need to gender swop as well as race swop a character? 🤔

It's a great sci fi film but it's not quite the masterpiece it's being heralded as imo.

I'm sure it will predictably win countless awards. FX. Couple of actors performances.

The script shouldn't though imo.

The ending felt totally rushed and zero resistance felt, no tension. Far too easy and brief a victory imo. Could have done with at least another half hour to really feel them gaining ground and getting ever closer to the Emperor. But no........they were there at the doors in a heartbeat which I was surprised by. Missed opportunity to build tension, suspense and bring great performances from the cast especially Walken is wasted here. (More on that later)

Feyd actor wasn't great and looked like a cross between Matt Lucas (Little Britain) and the Engineers from Prometheus 😁and his 'Birthday' scene in the arena seemed pointless and badly executed.

Batista's lack of acting abilities showed in this to the point he just shouted all his dialogue and hoped for the best.

Christopher Walken seemed wasted and was never really allowed to embrace the role with the little screen time he had. Didn't come across as Emperor at all. No grandeur at all. This is the Emperor of the Universe !!?

Anyone elsenspot the almost Monty Python Life of Brian moment. ""Only the true Messiah would deny he is the Messiah"" (or words there abouts) nearly had us shouting out ""He's not the Messiah he's a really naughty boy!"" Ha ha. 😂😂

Again. Well worth the watch though. The religious nods to real life from the book, the jihad, the politics are there although most is skirted over as it wouldn't make quite an exciting film. It's more style over substance. Visually nice yet not hugely engaging intellectually.

The designs for the spaceships seemed a little bland also, no real style or identity for each 'House'. At least Lynch film had some well thought out difference in the look of each houses palace and ships etc.

Bland. Especially after seeing what H R Giger had designed for the Harkonen style (for a film that sadly never got made many years ago). Oh how incredible that would have been If only it had happened. 😢🖤

Nownif only we could see Lynch's first 14hr cut. Ha ha. Love to see what treasure we're inside that version.

Music/ acting/ some action scenes/ location/ cgi all absolutely outstanding and I'm glad I saw it on the big screen but the story just isn't gripping at all and it's such a shame because the acting and the casting was spot on.

I would recommend that every person watches this film once because it is an experience and maybe I will have a more positive opinion once part 3 is out and the full story is there but overall a lot of hype with a minimal payoff at the end.

"Denis Villeneuve's *Dune: Part Two* is a bold and divisive sequel that fully embraces the epic scale and moral complexity of Frank Herbert's original novel. It's a film that will undoubtedly provoke strong reactions, as it delves deep into the dark consequences of messianic prophecies and the destructive power of unchecked ambition.

The film picks up where the first installment left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) embracing his role as the Muad'Dib. His powers grow exponentially, enabling him to manipulate sandworms, control minds, and predict the future. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and Paul's actions begin to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.

The Fremen, under the leadership of Chani (Zendaya), become a formidable force under Paul's guidance, but their victory comes at a terrible cost. The holy war against the oppressive galactic empire, is unleashed, leading to unimaginable suffering and destruction.

The film doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of Paul's character, as his thirst for power and control grows. His relationship with Chani becomes increasingly strained as he becomes consumed by his destiny. The performances from both Chalamet and Zendaya are exceptional, capturing the complexities of their characters with nuance and depth.

The supporting cast delivers strong performances, with Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen standing out as a charismatic and ruthless villain. Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan is a complex figure, caught between loyalty to her family and a growing admiration for Paul.

*Dune: Part Two* is even more stunning than its predecessor. The desert planet of Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail, and the large-scale battle sequences are both thrilling and horrifying. Hans Zimmer's score continues to be a highlight, providing a powerful emotional backdrop to the story.

However, the film's exploration of themes such as religion, ecology, and the dangers of unchecked power may be challenging for some viewers. The ending is particularly divisive, leaving a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty that will linger long after the credits roll.

*Dune: Part Two* is a bold and uncompromising film that demands to be seen and discussed. It is a sequel that expands upon the world-building of the first film while also exploring the darker implications of its story. While it may not be for everyone, it is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement that will be remembered for years to come.",deni villeneuv dune part two bold divis sequel fulli embrac epic scale moral complex frank herbert origin novel it film undoubtedli provok strong reaction delv deep dark consequ messian propheci destruct power uncheck ambit the film pick first instal left paul atreid timoth chalamet embrac role muaddib hi power grow exponenti enabl manipul sandworm control mind predict futur howev great power come great respons paul action begin farreach devast consequ the fremen leadership chani zendaya becom formid forc paul guidanc victori come terribl cost the holi war oppress galact empir unleash lead unimagin suffer destruct the film doesnt shi away explor darker aspect paul charact thirst power control grow hi relationship chani becom increasingli strain becom consum destini the perform chalamet zendaya except captur complex charact nuanc depth the support cast deliv strong perform austin butler feydrautha harkonnen stand charismat ruthless villain florenc pugh princess irulan complex figur caught loyalti famili grow admir paul dune part two even stun predecessor the desert planet arraki brought life breathtak detail largescal battl sequenc thrill horrifi han zimmer score continu highlight provid power emot backdrop stori howev film explor theme religion ecolog danger uncheck power may challeng viewer the end particularli divis leav sen ambigu uncertainti linger long credit roll dune part two bold uncompromis film demand seen discus it sequel expand upon worldbuild first film also explor darker implic stori while may everyon undoubtedli cinemat achiev rememb year come
"This movie ends the debate right here.

Villeneuve is currently the greatest filmmaker in the sci-fi genre on the entire planet.

Arrival - Blade Runner 2049 - Dune - Dune Part II

Four back-to-back sci-fi classics.

All of them released within a span of only 8 years, it's just unheard of. The man has truly conquered this genre and become its face.

Dune Part II takes everything from its already brilliant predecessor and elevates it to a completely new level. It's one of the rare sequels that convincingly surpasses the original.

Saying this movie is a ""must-watch"" would be a massive understatement.",thi movi end debat right villeneuv current greatest filmmak scifi genr entir planet arriv blade runner dune dune part ii four backtoback scifi classic all releas within span year unheard the man truli conquer genr becom face dune part ii take everyth alreadi brilliant predecessor elev complet new level it one rare sequel convincingli surpass origin say movi mustwatch would massiv understat
"I wasn't expecting to have a religious experience, but I guess that's how those sorts of things happen. The book is near and dear to me and, regardless of the changes made from the book, 10/10 doesn't quite do it justice. Sure, I could knit-pick, but any issues I might have are more than made up for. Sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story. What a time to be alive. Faith in cinema restored completely. Zendaya's Chani, though she doesn't impact the narrative much, frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that can't be silenced. Chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet, reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path. Javier Bardem brings the deep reverance, teacher, philosopher, and comic relief elements seemlessly. I don't know where to stop with the cast, so I'll just leave it there. The whole cast is wall-to-wall bullet proof. Absolute feast for the senses. Definitely see it in imax if you can. I could go on for days. Two thumbs up with a tear in the blue-within-blue eye.

".. there is a wall. Not a shield wall, that protects Arrakeen from the deep desert, but rather a cultural wall. A wall where those who came before are used to a higher quality, a finesse in filmmaking, which is lost on those who came later. Who like LOUD, BIG, and absolutely on-the-nose film.

While i place on a pedestal the immortal masterpiece by Lynch, Dune 2 was just mediocre. Not as bad as Dune .. uh .. 1? But still not really good.

I mean, i can't forget that i have seen 1984 Dune, so maybe i could like this a bit more if the first film never existed. I could forget the magnificent sets, the fantastic costumes, the amazing soundtrack, the superb direction and pacing, the acting of Jose Ferrer, of Kenneth McMillian, of Max von Sydow. We could forget that Lynch figured out that Space Kungfu wouldn't work and fixed the fighting and the ending, but then i would be left only with what little Dune 2 has to offer - a bunch of bland CGI stolen from the internet, horrible costumes, and a story which would maybe have better impact if it had anything like a decent direction. While VIlleneuve did the fairly good Sicario, to me he will always be the guy who made a mockery of Blade Runner.

And here is the wall. You either do, or do not like. You are on one side or the other. You can't like the new Blade Runner and also like the old one, you can't like Dune 2 and Dune 1984 at the same time, because if you grew up with the cinema sensibility that created such masterpieces as the original Dune and Blade Runner, you will simply be bored at the complete lack of artistic quality that their remakes have. And if you DO like the new ones, you don't even know what to look at, when you're shown the old ones.

Dune 2 was bad. Not horrible bad, but disappointing, sad bad. Sad that we insult the intelligence of our audience so much, and sad that they can't even tell.

"I had great hopes for ""Dune: part two"" since I really liked the first part but I was left a bit disappointed. Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in ""part two"". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.

The other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to ""Empire Strikes Back"" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of ""Episode V"" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that ""something is more to come, the final battle is nearing"". ""Dune: part two"" is instead cut anticlimactically.

Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by ""Dune: part two"" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential. It could have been something truly epic and for the ages, instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself.",i great hope dune part two sinc i realli like first part i left bit disappoint onc technic aspect product phenomen everyth well craft direct cinematographi product design perform score undoubtedli big part film recogn save thi narr part lot issu if first movi still slow pace abl creat imaginari becom icon purpos set second part i thought sort payoff come part two instead even second movi setup final battl last like minut rush anticlimact final but first part took time better justifi charact action second part doesnt mayb screen time would benefici mani time charact thing nowher stori need action doesnt feel earn justifi case im say bad i like movi rate show could much the issu part two end essenti part one three year later merit defect it technic except sure abl impress foment on flip side abl make viewer empath much charact worst thing truncat i accept first one build first part book bad i get sequel come theori stori interrupt ive read comparison empir strike back middl part trilog plot movi close inde last shot episod v clear indic closur stori narrat open fact someth come final battl near dune part two instead cut anticlimact unfortun im pretti disappoint dune part two movi i expect year i like i felt lot wast potenti it could someth truli epic age instead major issu reduc impact movi
"Its a teen romance drama masqueraded as a scifi movie. From the 2,47 hour runtime 1.30 hours are close up shots of Zendayas face like in soap operas. I saw this movie a few days ago and have already forgotten most of it. People who have rated this as a 10 have most likely forgotten how actual 10s make you feel, those movies stay in your mind for a long while. I mean movies the alien, blade runner, even a little never movies like district 9.. Dune is not even close to those, in any category. Its a sad fact a great scifi epic is reduced to the most simplest form, and theyll be making at least two sequals.

"This was an incredible achievement in film. I was completely blown away by the cinematography, acting, writing, music and more. If it gets topped this year than it will be a legendary film in the history of movies. I only had a couple problems but it's not with the movie it's just that they took out the characters of Alia and Leto. In the book Alia kills the baron and Leto is brutally murdered by the sardukar. Other than that which was just a adaption problem I thought it was completely perfect. Watch my YouTube reviews and subscribe to @filmratty

"From start to end, the world, this movie is bringing to life will leave your eyes wide open throughout the movie. If you're a Sci-Fi lover, there won't be a second you won't be left in awe. Watching the movie was like going through best moments of your own life, when you think that this is the climax there comes another. The Soundtrack will leave you a heart full of emotions when you leave the theatre. It doesn't fail to deliver the universe it promised.

"Yes, Dune 1 & 2 are probably the best sci-fi movies ever. I can't really come up with anything else that would beat these anyway.

Part Two was a nice continuation to Part One, however I felt the last part of the movie could have been better or maybe it just went too fast. Without spoiling its hard to explain. Also missed some more insight about the mother and a lot of other things as well... Imagine if this could have been a 20 episode serie with same quality!

Anyhow visually and the main cast were just excellent. I did expect more out of the emperor Christofer Walken.

Just love the tonality of the entire movie and the sound and music made it masterful.

"I read the first 3 Dune books about 15 years ago, I was a pretty big Dune dork back in the day, but then my interest waned and life got in the way. So I'd say my POV is somewhere between a mega Dune fan, and the general audience who doesn't know anything about the books. Zoom forward to 2021 and though I was excited for Part 1, I wasn't blown away by it (though I must admit I've enjoyed Part 1 more and more each time I've watched it). I went into Part 2 more curious than excited, but my gosh was I surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! I was running a little late to my showtime, and didn't get a chance to use the restroom before. I kept waiting for a ""slow"" or boring scene to sneak out--and that scene never came. Every moment felt important, and each scene held my attention so completely, that I decided the discomfort of needing to void wasn't worth missing a beat. So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. It's been a really long time since I've had such a visceral reaction to a movie; I kept thinking to myself, ""the movies are back!!"" And even though it's long, by the end I was actually sad because I wanted more...although at least I could finally pee! ;)",i read first dune book year ago i pretti big dune dork back day interest wane life got way so id say pov somewher mega dune fan gener audienc doesnt know anyth book zoom forward though i excit part i wasnt blown away though i must admit ive enjoy part time ive watch i went part curiou excit gosh i surpris much i enjoy i run littl late showtim didnt get chanc use restroom i kept wait slow bore scene sneak outand scene never came everi moment felt import scene held attent complet i decid discomfort need void wasnt worth miss beat so i guess rather silli tell use restroom learn mistak dune part mesmer beauti heartbreak it realli long time sinc ive viscer reaction movi i kept think movi back and even though long end i actual sad i want morealthough least i could final pee
"This movie is quite possibly the best sci-fi film ever made. The cinematography, the score, the chapters and how the story unfolds is so satisfying. This is not a 1 to 1 adaptation from the source material obviously but the choices that Denis(the director) and Grieg(the cinematographer) made were so intelligent. The world building is spectacular, the fights are action packed, the emotional weight in certain scenes is palpable. The actors all played their rolls flawlessly with stand out performances by Timothy chalemet, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem and Zendaya. I can't think of anything more they could have done to make this film more enjoyable.. except perhaps add another hour. 10/10 no question.",thi movi quit possibl best scifi film ever made the cinematographi score chapter stori unfold satisfi thi adapt sourc materi obvious choic denisth director griegth cinematograph made intellig the world build spectacular fight action pack emot weight certain scene palpabl the actor play roll flawlessli stand perform timothi chalemet austin butler javier bardem zendaya i cant think anyth could done make film enjoy except perhap add anoth hour question
"Dune Part Two is one of the greatest creations or triumphs in the history of cinema. The world-building and the world itself, along with our characters, makes you wanna snort a pile full of spice straight from the sand dunes of Arrakis and fight alongside Paul Atreides the entire time. That's how immersive the story, visuals, and music are. It is UNMATCHED.

A generation-defining film indeed, and when we discuss sequels, this could very well stand in contrast with 'The Empire Strikes Back,' 'The Dark Knight,' and 'The Two Towers'-or even surpass them in some cases. We owe Denis a great debt for this masterpiece. You can keep your expectations as high as the sky, but Denis will blow your mind either way and show you that even the sky isn't the limit. No one was and is prepared for this.

"I'm not going to say much. The first part was better. This movie added different plot twists, but then cut off entire subplots from the book. Visually stunning but too fast paced. Normally a fast paced plot keeps you on edge, but in this case everything was developed so quickly, that you simply moved on to the next plot point. I'm sure their will be plenty of fans especially those that never read the book, but IMHO it was missing something. I would dare say it had no heart. The movie just seemed to go through the motions. Eliminate character A , and give his\her part to character B, check. Add a plot twist, does it make sense, who cares, check.",im go say much the first part better thi movi ad differ plot twist cut entir subplot book visual stun fast pace normal fast pace plot keep edg case everyth develop quickli simpli move next plot point im sure plenti fan especi never read book imho miss someth i would dare say heart the movi seem go motion elimin charact a give hisher part charact b check add plot twist make sen care check
"I loved the first movie, even though it slowly built the plot I am familiar with all the dune books and was happy with how it was done. This second movie though is on another level altogether. Just been to the cinema to see it with friends and we were all overwhelmed, definitely this will be the best movie of this year, maybe of this decade. Some slight changes from the books but I can understand why they were made and I think they add to the film.

This is a complex film that works on so many levels. All of us would happily have watched it again immediately, there are so many small details and elements to love.

Do yourself a favour and go to the conema and see this.

I think the third film may not be so good as the third book not so great, being set 12 years after the ending of part 2 when paul is on power for some time, but I am still looking forward to it.

People are comparing this film to Dark Night and Empire strikes back. That is not Hype, I agree. Despite game of thrones being inspired by Frank Herberts Dune and sharing many themes, and despite similarities used by Lucas in Star Wars, if anything the plot elements work even better here in the priginal.",i love first movi even though slowli built plot i familiar dune book happi done thi second movi though anoth level altogeth just cinema see friend overwhelm definit best movi year mayb decad some slight chang book i understand made i think add film thi complex film work mani level all u would happili watch immedi mani small detail element love do favour go conema see i think third film may good third book great set year end part paul power time i still look forward peopl compar film dark night empir strike back that hype i agre despit game throne inspir frank herbert dune share mani theme despit similar use luca star war anyth plot element work even better prigin
"The perfect movie doesn't exis.... Dune made me feel nostalgia so badly for a time i never lived. I'm so in love with the way it made me feel excited and anxious and amazed in every litle frame and I'm sure this movie would never be the same without Zimmer.

The scenes where Chani gets emotional without saying anything shows how phenomenal Zendaya is. Who cries with their chin like that?

Also I thought that Timothée evolved a lot as an actor and the third act was breathtaking because of it.

I loved how the Bene Gesserit plot shows us a side of the story that resembles real life, I loved the way it all became very tangible.",the perfect movi doesnt exi dune made feel nostalgia badli time never live im love way made feel excit anxiou amaz everi litl frame im sure movi would never without zimmer the scene chani get emot without say anyth show phenomen zendaya who cri chin like also i thought timoth evolv lot actor third act breathtak i love bene gesserit plot show u side stori resembl real life i love way becam tangibl
"We just saw it today and I have to say I enjoyed every moment. I missed seeing a movie worth the trip to a cinema and I have lived throughout every moment of it.

They did justice to the book, it is so beautifully filmed and created, and the music complements every scene. They also managed to send the correct messages from the book who are still so valid or even more important nowadays. And to be fair the young cast also rose to the occasion and did well for their characters. It was beautiful to watch and impressive to hear.

One might say it feels too slow paced at some point but it is for a good reason, and what comes next is explosive. I love it.",we saw today i say i enjoy everi moment i miss see movi worth trip cinema i live throughout everi moment they justic book beauti film creat music complement everi scene they also manag send correct messag book still valid even import nowaday and fair young cast also rose occas well charact it beauti watch impress hear one might say feel slow pace point good reason come next explos i love
"This story should not work in a sci fi epic and yet it'll go down as one of the greatest films ever made.

Visually and emotionally stimulating with an incredible score. It's perfect from start to finish, incredibly well shot, and you almost can't believe a film this beautiful now exists.

That opening scene of the Fremen, attacking the Harkonnens just made me feel like I was watching this film 20 years in the future still in awe of its beauty.

A couple key changes from the book: Chani is not as against Paul's decision to fulfill the prophecy, Gurney attempts to kill Lady Jessica, and no son of Paul and Chani to kill the Baron.

I've actually only seen it 3 times so far, but I'll go every week until this leaves theaters.

"To be honest this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in years, Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done it better. The buildup for the main idea of the movie was unbelievable, how he planted the idea of the movie in the back of our mind was out of this world, this only happens when you take care of the least of the details, we can see in this movie how Denis made sure that he didn't waste any detail. The amount of details in the movie can be compared to the greatest movies ever made, everything was on point the designs of the locations were outrageous, the accent difference between the Northern and Southern people of Arakkis, the clothing to be honest everything was on point. The outrageous buildup made the conclusion very glorious and we cannot wait to see Dune: Part 3.

For the frist time in while i make an exception for Dune part two, and I'm not regret any moment of those two and half hours of masterpiece which definitely is Dune part two. I'm in love with this movie, this is perfection, incredibly balancing between dialogues and action. Music in this movie was also 10/10... Hans Zimmer really knows how to match those instruments with scenes that we see. Next part is acting, and... oh boy... Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler were my favorites.

"One of the best movies I've ever seen. True to sci-fi, dark, intense, amazing cinematography, quality acting, and with exciting action. I still find it hard to believe that a movie with so much in it is so well put together. As well, I'm quite surprised that it's received so much mainstream buzz because it partially feels like a real sci-fi movie if that makes any sense. But I can understand how there's enough here to appeal to all fans of cinema.

It's an instant classic for me. It actually surpassed Dune Part One and delivered on all fronts. Part One did a great job at setting the scene and Part Two knocked it out of the park. I would give it a 9.5/10 because it's a bit long and there's a lot to follow throughout the entirety of the movie, it can get a bit taxing.

"I was very excited about seeing Dune part two today. I have been waiting for it with expectancy. Number one was so good that I've watched it half a dozen times because it's so much like the book. I have only one question and one criticism of this movie, why did you have to change the end? Everything was going along just fine until you changed the ending. Frank Herbert wrote a great story, a great book and a great ending and I just don't understand why you needed to change the end It's very disappointing and it's not worth watching again because it's not the story that I am used to. So as I said, after the Kyle McLaughlin version of Dune, what book did you read? Because it certainly wasn't Dune.",i excit see dune part two today i wait expect number one good ive watch half dozen time much like book i one question one critic movi chang end everyth go along fine chang end frank herbert wrote great stori great book great end i dont understand need chang end it disappoint worth watch stori i use so i said kyle mclaughlin version dune book read becaus certainli wasnt dune

Please keep this going through all six books. This is the absolutely best rendering of a very complex story. The first Dune was OK. The BBC mini series was good. This kicks it out of the ball yard. The characters and acting nail it. Please keep going because this book series deserves this kind of engagement and understanding. The debunking of the messiah myth. The conflict is perfectly recognized in this rendition. I can't wait for the next part of this and seeing how you render the God emperor.

"Dune Part 2, clocking in at over two hours, delivers a captivating cinematic experience. The stellar performances, meticulous plot execution, and awe-inspiring cinematography collectively contribute to an outstanding film. Each actor excels in their role, and the costume designs are commendable.

While the movie shines in various aspects, it occasionally leans heavily on visual effects, reaching a point of excessiveness. Despite this, the overarching narrative brilliantly delves into the theme of religious fanaticism. The spiritual motifs in Dune draw striking parallels to messianic concepts, echoing the biblical narrative of Jesus and his mission to liberate humanity from tyranny over 2000 years ago in our world. Overall, Dune Part 2 successfully navigates the delicate balance between visual spectacle and profound storytelling, making it a noteworthy cinematic experience.",dune part clock two hour deliv captiv cinemat experi the stellar perform meticul plot execut aweinspir cinematographi collect contribut outstand film each actor excel role costum design commend while movi shine variou aspect occasion lean heavili visual effect reach point excess despit overarch narr brilliantli delv theme religi fanatic the spiritu motif dune draw strike parallel messian concept echo biblic narr jesu mission liber human tyranni year ago world overal dune part success navig delic balanc visual spectacl profound storytel make noteworthi cinemat experi

"It's truly refreshing to experience a big-budget blockbuster in theaters where the director is given creative freedom without being suffocated by studio interference.

Denis Villeneuve was clearly able to bring his vision to life in this second installment of 'DUNE,' and what a success it is. Similar to the first film, the sound and visuals are stunning, with the colors in many scenes leaving me utterly speechless.

This movie features significantly more action and fighting, which is understandable given that the first film focused on establishing the environment and explaining the world of 'DUNE.'

I particularly appreciated how Paul's visions were integrated into the story, as well as the exploration of the various religious themes without giving away spoilers. Although I haven't read the book, I felt that Villeneuve did an excellent job of translating the complex themes from the source material onto the screen.",it truli refresh experi bigbudget blockbust theater director given creativ freedom without suffoc studio interfer deni villeneuv clearli abl bring vision life second instal dune success similar first film sound visual stun color mani scene leav utterli speechless thi movi featur significantli action fight understand given first film focus establish environ explain world dune i particularli appreci paul vision integr stori well explor variou religi theme without give away spoiler although i havent read book i felt villeneuv excel job translat complex theme sourc materi onto screen
"I love it. There's something special about this cinematic experience that brings back the nostalgia of the early 2000s when the best movies came out. It's a time when anticipation built up for months, if not years, before a major film's release. I particularly enjoy that it's once again similar like back in the days when you were genuinely excited to await a movie's release. The kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family. As a hard-working man, finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare. I can enjoy a trilogy again as if I were a fan, just like in the old days, finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment, the outside world fades away. It makes me feel young again, reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility I had back then. This movie is brilliant, not just in its execution but in its vision. I love how they incorporated Islamic prophecies. It's a testament to the film's commitment to not just entertain but to educate.

"Dune Part 2 is nothing short of a spectacular cinematic experience. The score is on another level. Hans Zimmer takes what you already know and makes it even more impactful. You have to experience it on big screen with sounds completely overflowing and captivating you. The cast is simply perfect. Unforgettable performances from Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem and Timothee Chalamet. As a huge fan of the books, I say they made them justice! This is a fantastic adaptation of Frank Herbert's world. Whatever they changed, they did a good job with it and it all makes sense. Some things just wouldn't work on screen and you all know it.

"The production value of the sets and scene is spectacular. Now that is out of the way the movie is very average and nothing really happens. The editing is very choppy and the movie keeps jumping here and there. Everything happens conveniently for the main character. The fight sequence which i was waiting for were short and underwhelming.

Props to the director for making it almost 3 hours long but still unable to stitch a decent storyline. Poor Zendaya was so underutilized that it made no sense why Paul was having dreams of her in the first part. His premonitions were so useless, his dreams in the first part didn't warn him about the massacres about to happen to his family but kept showing him Zendaya (really useless superpower to have). There are multiple oscar winning actors who have been criminally underutilized (Josh Brolin, Javier B, Chris W).

Again the production value is great and makes it watchable but was too slow, nothing really happened and when it happened was underwhelming.",the product valu set scene spectacular now way movi averag noth realli happen the edit choppi movi keep jump everyth happen conveni main charact the fight sequenc wait short underwhelm prop director make almost hour long still unabl stitch decent storylin poor zendaya underutil made sen paul dream first part hi premonit useless dream first part didnt warn massacr happen famili kept show zendaya realli useless superpow there multipl oscar win actor crimin underutil josh brolin javier b chri w again product valu great make watchabl slow noth realli happen happen underwhelm
"A movie of grace and beauty. A faultless sequel to a complex and challenging story. Denis Villenvuve had joined the pantheon of great sci-fi directors. He understands the source material and brings to life a book that requires so much to do. The actors all excel under his vision and they embody their characters with absolute conviction.

The lighting and cinematography is of the highest standard and it should result in many wins at the award season.

"I very rarely give 10/10 ratings to films, but DUNE II is easily the best movie I have ever seen!

This is why you go to the cinema: to be entertained!(not to be educated or being pressured to think a certain way).

When I go to the cinema and pay for a movie ticket I want quality, I want to be taken on a journey, very simple.

'Legendary Pictures' and 'Warner Brothers' have given Denis Villeneuve the respect as an artist and as a story teller to allow him to create his vision on the big screen - as it should be!

When studios interfere and micro manage projects it dilutes and spoils the quality of the film (Alien 3 is a perfect example of this).

Denis Villeneuve, Hans Zimmer, Jon Spaiths and Greig Fraser are the future of cinema!

The 2 hour and 46 runtime just flew by - the pacing was spot on. I easily could have sat there for 3 and a half hours!

The score by Hans Zimmer was just unbelievable and perfectly transports you into the world of DUNE for the entire runtime.

The cast and performances were all incredible, in particular Javier Bardem as Stilgar, he absolutely believed in Paul and his journey.

Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, was just awesome. I haven't seen much of his work prior to DUNE - his performance in part one was more subtle and this film sees him transform intimate a reluctant hero then gradually fully accepting his destiny - his speeches to the Fremen were incredible and gave me the chills.

Stellan Skarsgård as the Baron, just perfect casting, absolutely terrifying, a highly intelligent and repulsive character. Very well done.

The other stand out performance was Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha - just gave me the creeps anytime he was on screen and totally unrecognisable in the role, he is a chameleon.

I want to see DUNE 3 and DUNE Prophecy - let's make it happen!

We need to support films like DUNE 2, films that are of a high standard are very special and do not come along very often.

"There is something about Dune. You either dig it or you don't. I dig it. In fact I love it.

Dune came out as a novel in 1965, it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of 23,352 AD : ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it created.

The demon of AI has already been conceived and defeated. So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.

It could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.

It is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.

It is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.

But at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.

Dune is influential.

If you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).

I have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.

The casting in this version is perfect. The effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagery.

Dune has almost become a holy book for the sci-fi fan of a certain age, it even has a messiah. I am that kind of fan. Watching it has become a religious experience. You feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true. That makes it powerful.

That makes Dune part two simply superb.",there someth dune you either dig dont i dig in fact i love dune came novel set mind bogglingli distant year ad ten thousand year mankind overthrown intellig machin creat the demon ai alreadi conceiv defeat so unlik lot scifi stori peopl clever machin it could easili set crusad it grandeur expans it complex it belief faith full religi fervour surviv odd it also reveng justic it care manipul sow seed propheci nurtur plan span gener about know seiz moment time final come but time hero fulli awar destruct may bring dune influenti if youv watch star war film dune reluct hero live desert planet loom empir battl galaxi feel familiar after success first star war film luca term big sue i read dune mani time i watch david lynch film time i rememb in fact i watch dune part one five time the cast version perfect the effect impress big screen sound immers realli quit strike imageri dune almost becom holi book scifi fan certain age even messiah i kind fan watch becom religi experi you feel like watch propheci know well come true that make power that make dune part two simpli superb
"Initially, the film attacks the goals of the top of the filmography with the quality of the scenes, the set, the costumes and also working with the atmosphere. The actors are convincing and the environment, even if generated in places, is incorporated so that it is almost imperceptible. However, where the film's problem arises is in the dramaturgy. Working with film time is not goot at all. The movie sequences don't always fit together, and the closer we get to the end, the more problems there are in this area. In some places, the tension is cut off, and then the tension is missing and the logic of the characters' actions begins to hide. The worst thing is exactly the feeling of watching a movie. It's great that the film captures and hits, but it can't sustain interest all the time without problems. Just the fact that the viewer asks what time it is and how long it takes in the cinema, he notices the people around him and has to literally struggle to keep watching. When the real world starts talking to him through the illusion of the screen. That's a failure. As the film moves forward and nears the end, it becomes boring. The dramaturgy and the position of the characters in the story, their value for the story completely collapses towards the end and is saved only by the vision of a possible sequel. Well, it's not exactly a bad movie, but as a whole it lacks a pull at goal.",initi film attack goal top filmographi qualiti scene set costum also work atmospher the actor convinc environ even gener place incorpor almost impercept howev film problem aris dramaturgi work film time goot the movi sequenc dont alway fit togeth closer get end problem area in place tension cut tension miss logic charact action begin hide the worst thing exactli feel watch movi it great film captur hit cant sustain interest time without problem just fact viewer ask time long take cinema notic peopl around liter struggl keep watch when real world start talk illus screen that failur a film move forward near end becom bore the dramaturgi posit charact stori valu stori complet collaps toward end save vision possibl sequel well exactli bad movi whole lack pull goal
"This is one of the best if not the best sci fi movies ive ever seen, sure it felt a bit rushed but it ticked every box for me as far as sci fi movies go. The scale of the film, fantastic worldbuilding and all of the cast were just amazing. I absolutely love the raw and gritty portrail of the world, it felt real, like that this could actually be a possible future for humanity. As i mentioned before it felt a bit rushed sometimes but that is to be expected when you make a movie adaptation of a book so that did not bother me that much. I do however believe that this film needs to be rated R in order for it to reach its fullest potential. Showing a bit more realism in the battles etc would have made this a 10/10 for me. However the action was still great and the final fight scene was so f*in good.",thi one best best sci fi movi ive ever seen sure felt bit rush tick everi box far sci fi movi go the scale film fantast worldbuild cast amaz i absolut love raw gritti portrail world felt real like could actual possibl futur human a mention felt bit rush sometim expect make movi adapt book bother much i howev believ film need rate r order reach fullest potenti show bit realism battl etc would made howev action still great final fight scene fin good
"This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones.

"I really was looking forward to seeing this and I was disappointed completely. I read the book, I know about the project of Jodorowsky and I saw the version of David Lynch, so I know what Dune is about.

This version had some nice ideas for the cinematography, but nothing more. Timothee Chalamet is a complete let-down. He has exactly two facial expressions: the boyish, somehow stupid smile (fits for Willy Wonka, not for Paul Atreides) and another look of a freezing disappointed puppy. Not enough. There are scenes wre you desperately wait for him to act, but it is all compensated with the massive allways-sounding-the-same score. Yawn. Another let-down: The new version of Feyd-Rautha. I don' t like Sting, but he was much more convincing as a madmen, while Austin Butler just treis hard to act one. And than there are all those plot holes and illogical scenes: The Fremen hide under the sand to attack the harvester, but after some face-to-face-combat they destroy it with laser canon from a long distance. Why the first assault? Just to risk lifes? Stooooopid! Not even Zendaya or Xavier Bardem were worth watching this pathetic attempt of making a SciFi-movie.

"No spoilers here: I walked out of the cinema just under an hour ago, and I am writing this while it is still fresh.

Disclosure: As a reader of the original material, I am biased.

This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen, the score is absolutely phenomenal (Thanks Zimmer) and Villeneuve created an expansive and engaging experience, there were times that I simply couldn't comprehend the effects: although at times the CG did glare it's head.

Obviously I haven't seen it back to back with the previous film, yet, but when I have the opportunity I will definitely savour it.

"Part Two impressed me in a way I've never been impressed before. As expected, the visuals were top of the line and the action was spectacularly original. Part One was a little too slow pacing; Part Two was a little faster paced but so much more interesting. And I loved Paul's relationship with Chani. I've seen so many cringy, stereotypical, and generic romances, but theirs was moving. I loved how there was so much passion and emotion displayed in their eyes, but left out most of the dialogue associated with other romances. The Emperor may have been the overarching villain, but the climactic fight was Paul's single combat against Feyd-Rautha, and that was something. The choice to not use music or slow motion shots was atypical, but it made for one of the most stressful heart-pounding hand-to-hand fights I've ever witnessed. As a whole, Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest movie experiences of my life, so just imagine watching it in theaters instead of on a mobile device.",part two impress way ive never impress a expect visual top line action spectacularli origin part one littl slow pace part two littl faster pace much interest and i love paul relationship chani ive seen mani cringi stereotyp gener romanc move i love much passion emot display eye left dialogu associ romanc the emperor may overarch villain climact fight paul singl combat feydrautha someth the choic use music slow motion shot atyp made one stress heartpound handtohand fight ive ever wit a whole dune part two one greatest movi experi life imagin watch theater instead mobil devic

"I don't know what can you say about this movie that wasn't already said. Unbelievable cinematography, CGI, casting, fabulous music and villains. Villneuve did the impossible, adapt probably the hardest book ever in the S. F. universe. Part one was great but part two is FLAWLESS. Do yourself a favor and watch it in IMAX, seriously, you won't regret it.

Who didn't read the books (I envy you, to be able to read it for the 1st time 😀) may talk about minor issues with the script but the director was so faithful to the books and you don't see that in Hollywood nowadays. Of course, you can't cover and entire book in just 2 and a half hour of a movie, but he did it! Villneuve cements his place in the pantheon of top tier directors with this movie.

I can't wait for part 3, I refuse to believe there won't be one, over the years he said his dream is to make a trilogy and close the circle.

In the end, all I can say is go watch the movie, do it in IMAX and enjoy a mind-blowing journey, in one of the best movies ever done.

"Choosing not to watch this masterpiece is the greatest disservice you could do for yourself. This may be the greatest movie I have ever seen. As someone who has never had a vested interest in the world of Dune, I had my eyes opened in part 1, but Denis Villeneuve's sequel is nothing short of pure captivation. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack has not left my head since the movie began. The cinematography is some of the most visually stunning across such a variety of scenes. Austin Butler was an absolute force with the little screen time he had, a terrifying and psychotic villain that rivals some of the greats. Timothy Chalamet's command of attention of all was unmatched. The chants of ""Lisan al Gaib"" have replayed over and over in my head for the past day. I already have tickets to rewatch and will be shocked if that's the last time I see it.",choos watch masterpiec greatest disservic could thi may greatest movi i ever seen a someon never vest interest world dune i eye open part deni villeneuv sequel noth short pure captiv han zimmer soundtrack left head sinc movi began the cinematographi visual stun across varieti scene austin butler absolut forc littl screen time terrifi psychot villain rival great timothi chalamet command attent unmatch the chant lisan al gaib replay head past day i alreadi ticket rewatch shock that last time i see

The certain thing is that the part two doesnt disappoint in any section, I thing that only improves and when I mean improve I dont say in technical terms but the viewer appreciate even more the scenario the characters every spectrum of the film.

"So. Frank Herbert told a story of religious fervor and how it warps the minds of people. Dennis Villeneuve wanted to capture it and did so very well.

With this film Villeneuve creates a grand tapestry of cultural expression which we have never seen before. The different planets have their very distinct feel to them, in both sight and sound and one never feels like it's too much or too weird, it's just the right amount. Villeneuve managed to capture and create his own totality of the world of Dune. Some could say he leaves certain parts of the book out which they miss, but just as with Peter Jacksons trilogy, this movie eminates a passion from both director, cinematographer, composer, vfx artists, sound designers, it's clear they wanted to tell Frank Herberts story, and they certainly did!

Hollywood is in a crisis, why? Just because people have stopped going to the movie theatres? Well, as we see with this movie which has already broken many box office records, people haven't necessarily stopped going to the cinema, they just don't wanna waste money on bad movies. So the Hollywood crisis is, sure, partly due to technological change, but also to a severe lack of good stories to tell. And funnily enough, the lack of stories to tell in 2024 has a parallel to the story of Dune 2, mainly in that the prophet of Paul Atreides is precisly the story the Fremen need to reach beyond the dunes and out into the galaxy, we need a similar story to reach beyond ourselves today too. But as Dennis Villeneuve and Frank Herbert so brilliantly shows us, it can very easily go bad.

I tell you though. When watching this film, you cannot help yourself, you are just dragged along whether you want to or not. Chalamet, Bardem, Ferguson, Zendaya, Skarsgård, Butler they all do their parts so well. I would say Zendaya has a tendency to be in the permanent ""I carelessly dissaprove""-role, but even she manages to break out of it for this movie.

The thing that impressed me the most is the authenticity of the different cultural expressions as I mentioned before, the Harkonnen aestethics, the choice of having a black and white sun, the Fremen funeral rite, the accuracy of shamanic rituals, the costumes, it all feels like a window into a different reality more than a movie.

Dune 2 is filled with plot progress, character development, action & drama and there are almost no minutes wasted and almost everything was executed brilliantly. I felt like I was in the cinema for a while but still would've prefered it to be double or even triple the length it was just that good.

If we stick to the film as an adaptation, it will lower its rating, but if we focus on the film as a pure and simple cinematic work, it's a great film and surely, if not the best film of the year, it will be among the top 5.

"Dune Part 2 is cinema. Pure, unbridled cinema. It combines blockbuster level polish and action with some of the most thought-provoking, timely themes in a sci-fi movie in the past decade.

The writing is thoughtful and engaging. The acting from everyone is absolutely superb (standouts from Javier Bardem and Timothee Chalamet). The music is stunning, and the sound design even more so. Giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing, and explosive action scenes never more raw. The CGI is exquisite. Never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial. The best part, though, has to be the cinematography. Almost every single shot could be a wallpaper, poster, or painting.

In an age where big-budget movies are floundering, and tired franchises are puttering out, Dune is bringing crowd-pleasing, epic movies back. I can't wait for the next chapter.

"One of the difficulties of a movie like this is that there is so much dialogue involved. Some parts feel similar to LOTR in its dialogue but mostly it doesn't seem to meet the standard of touching one's heart and mind. Much of the movie's pacing is slow and coupled with uninteresting dialogue or, at times, tangential dialogue, it makes it hard for average viewers to engage. The movies seem to build to what should be an epic ending, which ultimately seemed lackluster and small. I definitely didn't feel attached to characters in this story as one might like to be... Any character could have been killed and it would have had minimal impact on me as a viewer.

"Dune Part Two (2024)"" had all the ingredients for greatness, yet it falls tragically short. As a devout fan of Frank Herbert's epic saga, I approached this sequel with high hopes, only to be met with profound disappointment.

The most glaring flaw lies in its butchered storytelling. The intricate plot of Herbert's masterpiece is treated with a careless disregard, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. Instead of delving into the depth and complexity of the source material, the film meanders through superfluous scenes that add little to the overarching story.

Where the1984 Dune adaptation succeeded was in its faithful and nuanced storytelling. Each scene served a purpose, advancing the plot and deepening our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The pacing was deliberate, allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe.

In contrast, ""Dune Part Two"" feels like a series of missed opportunities. Important plot points are glossed over or omitted entirely, leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied. Characters lack depth and development, reducing them to mere caricatures of their literary counterparts.

While the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and the performances commendable, they cannot compensate for the film's fundamental narrative shortcomings. ""Dune Part Two"" is a prime example of style over substance, a hollow shell of what could have been a truly remarkable cinematic experience.

In conclusion, ""Dune Part Two"" fails spectacularly in capturing the essence of Herbert's masterpiece. Its rushed plot and inclusion of unnecessary scenes detract from the overall experience, leaving audiences longing for the depth and nuance of the original 1984 adaptation.",dune part two ingredi great yet fall tragic short a devout fan frank herbert epic saga i approach sequel high hope met profound disappoint the glare flaw lie butcher storytel the intric plot herbert masterpiec treat careless disregard result rush disjoint narr instead delv depth complex sourc materi film meander superflu scene add littl overarch stori where dune adapt succeed faith nuanc storytel each scene serv purpos advanc plot deepen understand charact motiv the pace deliber allow viewer immers fulli rich tapestri herbert univers in contrast dune part two feel like seri miss opportun import plot point gloss omit entir leav viewer bewild unsatisfi charact lack depth develop reduc mere caricatur literari counterpart while visual undoubtedli stun perform commend cannot compens film fundament narr shortcom dune part two prime exampl style substanc hollow shell could truli remark cinemat experi in conclus dune part two fail spectacularli captur essenc herbert masterpiec it rush plot inclus unnecessari scene detract overal experi leav audienc long depth nuanc origin adapt

"Dune part 2 delivered in every way on what part 1 began, and served as an artfully brilliant adaption of the source material. Frank Herbert's Dune is my favorite book of all time, and I was more than pleased with the translation to the screen that Denis Villeneuve masterfully put together. The scenery, world-building, character development, music, sound effects, pacing, and overall feeling, in my opinion, perfect for this story. There were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen, which I felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the book.

I especially loved this movie's depiction of Paul's internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for Chani and the Fremen people. He is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations, controlled prophecies, love, loss, and fear of greater loss and suffering. All of this internal turmoil is heard in Paul's words, tone, and seen on his face. Lady Jessica's portrayal is terrifying and unsettling. Chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with. Stilgar is devout and unironically hilarious at times.

Every shot of the movie is a work of art.

"This is one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. When I watch modern films I am often turned off by the poorly thought-out story, contemporary political issues and extremely inappropriate humor and swearing.

"Dude is a pillar of science fiction, and to see it done this well, especially in a climate of relatively subpar cinema has been nothing less than thrilling to watch.

Book readers will come away satisfied, and even with our nitpicks with the changes they've had to make from turning a large complex novel like Dune into a two hours and 45 minute movie, I was delighted with the tweaks they made. These changes not only helped make the story more coherent to a casual audience, but also highlighted some character motives without having to dive too deep into other plotlines.

For those were just looking to see a well-made piece of cinema, you will not be disappointed. It's a visually stunning, emotionally, gripping, and well crafted cautionary tale on charismatic leaders.

Denis Villeneuve take a bow. This is the kind of movie that comes around once every 20 years or so. 10/10.",dude pillar scienc fiction see done well especi climat rel subpar cinema noth less thrill watch book reader come away satisfi even nitpick chang theyv make turn larg complex novel like dune two hour minut movi i delight tweak made these chang help make stori coher casual audienc also highlight charact motiv without dive deep plotlin for look see wellmad piec cinema disappoint it visual stun emot grip well craft cautionari tale charismat leader deni villeneuv take bow thi kind movi come around everi year
"I loved this movie. It was never boring and the characters were perfectly cast. Timothy was great as Paul. There were a lot of fight scenes but they did not ruin the rest of the movie. I may end up seeing it a second time. Fayed was the best looking Feyed so far. I felt if i has not read the book, then i might not have known what was happening to Paul via the spice. I did miss seeing his sister, and I don't quite understand why they changed that, even though I read the explanation. There are a few movies that i have been looking forward to, but this was number one on the list.

"I mean if you were to sum up humanity in one movie... this would be it!

So layered and nunanced in the deep topics it explores, yet it communicates this through a visual and visceral soundscape.

I haven't had such an immersive movie experience like this since Interstellar and that was up there until now as one of the best films made in my opinion.

Not only are we lucky to have one GOAT film maker alive at this moment in time but we have two simultaneously in Villeneuve and Nolan.

Having finished the book about an hour before my first screening this evening I was apprehensive in how the story would be translated visually due to its complexity but it blew past all my expectations and then sum.

This is the result of having the best of the best in their respective fields coming together to produce a Masterpiece be it in Fraser's cinematography, Zimmer's sound scape or the costume, set design and VFX departments... acting, writing and directing at the highest calibre.

Do yourself a favour and watch this on the big screen, IMAX, Dolby Atmos to capture the true effort gone into creating this work of art and to do it justice.

"Dune: Part Two comes out in a historic moment where world feel the need of a new Kolossal movie while every other big scale franchises are dooming.

Unfortunately Paul's epic tale suffers of incredibly slow pacing cuts and slow character building sequences. Imagine it takes one hour to get out of the ""become the messiah"" chapter. I liked the direction and the choice to cut meaningless chatting over a bigger direction with the world showing the events. Dialogues are often over filled with high fantasy terms and nomenclatures which I'm sure will lose the audience many times before you understand you don't actually need to understand what they mean to get the bigger picture.

Casting is probably one of the greatest I have ever seen with many having just a few lines of dialogues and/or not feeling invested in the characters they are portraying.

I can't stand Bautista to be the main villain for the first part of such a movie...Just to be replaced by a random dude with no charm that does a badass show-off for 5 minutes and become our tier S final boss.

"Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe, he must prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

I'd like to start off by mentioning that I didn't really like the first Dune. I felt like it was too slow and lacked significant events and was just setting up this part. Looking back, now I understand why that was the case. This part wouldn't have been as good without the setup from part one. The first scene in this movie is really visually beautiful and sets up the tone for the rest of the film. The movie is a 3 hour adventure in this incredible world were time just flys by. The production was fabulous and the action and fight scenes were super entertaining, big credits to the director Denis Villeneuve. Hans Zimmer's score is also a big selling point of the movie as it elevates the watching experience and changes the viewer's mood. The cast is also perfect and you can sense that there's a strong chemistry between all of the actors. The story is incredibly good but the storytelling could be a bit better. There are some points that leave you with question marks. But maybe that is left to be explained later. Which brings me on to the next point, I need closure. This film seems like its also setting up a next film so that's more than five hours of set up (with the durations of part one and two combined) with no clear end or a bit of closure. I get that this is supposed to be a big Sci-Fi film series but there has to be a point of where I feel like i didn't spend 5 hours on a journey with no sense of ending. Hopefully they change my mind regarding this point by the time Dune:Part Three releases. Other than that, it was an absolutely amazing film that has to be watched.

"Wow, just wow! ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of a sci-fi/fantasy marvel. If you thought the first part was good, get ready to be blown away. Denis Villeneuve has truly outdone himself, delivering a film that stands tall among the greatest epics of our time.

From start to finish, the movie is an absolute visual feast. The world-building is second to none, and the plot keeps you hooked with its perfectly paced story and jaw-dropping climax. Villeneuve's direction is impeccable, making him a true master of the genre. It's no wonder even Christopher Nolan praised this film!

Timothée Chalamet shines as Paul Atreides, embodying the role with charisma and depth. Zendaya has more screen time and she nails it, while Austin Butler is chilling as the villain. Rebecca Ferguson gives one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem adds a surprising touch of humor. The cast is stellar, each actor bringing their A-game.

Hans Zimmer's score is pure genius, elevating every scene to new heights. The technical aspects - VFX, sound, editing - are all top-notch and worthy of every award out there. The action sequences are mind-blowing, sending chills down my spine.

What I love most is how this film stands on its own. Sure, watching the first part helps, but ""Dune: Part Two"" is a self-contained masterpiece. It's better than the first in almost every way, serving as a perfect wrap-up to the story while leaving us hungry for more.

This movie is destined to be a major player in the next Award Season, and it deserves every bit of it. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen possible. ""Dune: Part Two"" is a cinematic experience you don't want to miss.

"The film starts exactly at the moment the first part ended. Although according to Villeneuve it is designed to be understood without having seen the first part, I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One before.

The first half of the film is poetic. Great shots of the desert. Developing new characters (especially Fremen) that we had seen briefly in the first part and, above all, we can see an evolution of some characters that we already knew. I highlight here the character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film. Bravo to Villeneuve for having developed Chani's character (wasted in Herbert's novel), here Chani shines until the end. Bardem, is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot, adding dynamism and even funny moments.

The second half of the film goes to Paul Atreides. I can't say too much here, only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that I've been seen in cinema. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply some of the best I have ever witnessed on a screen. Everything that was harvested in Dune: Part One now makes complete sense. The characters of Florence Pugh and Austin Butler stand out, the first one, in the background but being a totally key character, especially for everything that is going to come (Messiah); and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain (far above the Baron, a villain who personally never convinced me).

All of this is great, however, an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was: the music of Hans Zimmer. Spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate (literally... if you see it in Imax) every moment inside you. It is no coincidence that Nolan's best films have Zimmer's seal. His music creates art. His music creates blockbusters. Not because it's commercial, but because it creates emotions within you. Every note, sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film. Hans Zimmer's music is undoubtedly the specie, the Water of Life... of Dune: Part Two.

With all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created, but what is (be careful what I am going to say) the best film of this 21st century (at least to date), with permission from the Dark Knight and Interstellar.

Villeneuve gives us a great masterpiece. Here, however, the Messiah is not Paul Atreides, nor Villeneuve himself... The Messiah is the spectator. You. This film will push you to be a better you, it will make you dream big, it will remind you that, like Paul, you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others. You are the Chosen One to, within a simple movie, find the Gold that will make you better in your daily life.

This valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art, but only by a few works... which some of us dare to call... MASTERPIECES.

Because... in the shadows of Arrakis lie one secret... Dune 2 is a MASTERPIECE.",the film start exactli moment first part end although accord villeneuv design understood without seen first part i highli recommend watch dune part one the first half film poetic great shot desert develop new charact especi fremen seen briefli first part see evolut charact alreadi knew i highlight charact stilgar javier bardem chani zendaya undoubtedli get one great perform film bravo villeneuv develop chani charact wast herbert novel chani shine end bardem also fundament piec give fresh seriou majest plot ad dynam even funni moment the second half film goe paul atreid i cant say much see one greatest evolut charact ive seen cinema the last minut film simpli best i ever wit screen everyth harvest dune part one make complet sen the charact florenc pugh austin butler stand first one background total key charact especi everyth go come messiah second one excel perform villain far baron villain person never convinc all great howev element equal import everyth mention music han zimmer spectacular song sound make simpli feel vibrat liter see imax everi moment insid it coincid nolan best film zimmer seal hi music creat art hi music creat blockbust not commerci creat emot within everi note sound song place right time moment film han zimmer music undoubtedli speci water life dune part two with left best scienc fiction film ever creat care i go say best film st centuri least date permiss dark knight interstellar villeneuv give u great masterpiec here howev messiah paul atreid villeneuv the messiah spectat you thi film push better make dream big remind like paul decid lead life inspir other you chosen one within simpl movi find gold make better daili life thi valuabl lesson achiev ordinari piec art work u dare call masterpiec becaus shadow arraki lie one secret dune masterpiec

"After years of terrible sci-if action films, mainly by Disney we get a movie that lives up to its hype. Dennis Villanueve has done it. He's created an sci-fi action film that does everything right. By the end of the film, the entire theater was silenced in awe. The acting from Zendaya to Chalamet and Brolin was fantastic. My only complaint is I wish the final battle scene was a bit longer. It felt too short, but I'm nitpicking. Go out and spend your hard earned money, this film was meant to see on the big screen. This is truly a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Will be watching again very soon.",after year terribl sciif action film mainli disney get movi live hype denni villanuev done he creat scifi action film everyth right by end film entir theater silenc awe the act zendaya chalamet brolin fantast my complaint i wish final battl scene bit longer it felt short im nitpick go spend hard earn money film meant see big screen thi truli movi keep edg seat whole time will watch soon

"To be succinct, my issue with this movie is that many of the most interesting, clever, and unique story features that makes Dune so iconic were oversimplified and/or completely changed to make a very generic story that does not mirror the book in most any respect. Sitting in the theater, having only just finished my re-reading of Dune the day before, I realized that only about 20% of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context. The characters are simply not the same characters from the novel, but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations. Overall, the movie is not bad. I give it 5 out of 10 because it is a generic, middle of the pack movie. Which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score. Quite disappointing.",to succinct issu movi mani interest clever uniqu stori featur make dune icon oversimplifi andor complet chang make gener stori mirror book respect sit theater finish reread dune day i realiz movi materi scene novel even still scene taken complet differ context the charact simpli charact novel even first part appar inconsist motiv overal movi bad i give gener middl pack movi which even upset pair knowledg follow plot alreadi establish novel would provid much higher score quit disappoint
"I'm genuinely baffled why everyone felt this movie was so good. I've been a cinema fan for decades and in general a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve's other movies.

This one felt like maybe the scope got away from him. It was certainly epic, but it felt hollow.

It could have done away with quite a few battle scenes in favor for more interesting character development.

They made many decisions to depart from the book, which is fine, but they felt like pointless decisions that made the characters less interesting. Maybe less likable.

I'm blown away by how disappointed I am in this movie. I'll give it another watch or two in hopes it grows on me, but I'm struggling to see how it could.

Maybe if they make Part Three based on Dune Messiah it will be better because there are less battles in that book to use as a crutch.

If you want to see a bunch of people you barely know anything about stab each other for 3 hours. This is the movie for you.

If you're looking for some contemplative sprawling sci-fi that tackles interesting subject matter, best look elsewhere.",im genuin baffl everyon felt movi good ive cinema fan decad gener huge fan deni villeneuv movi thi one felt like mayb scope got away it certainli epic felt hollow it could done away quit battl scene favor interest charact develop they made mani decis depart book fine felt like pointless decis made charact less interest mayb less likabl im blown away disappoint i movi ill give anoth watch two hope grow im struggl see could mayb make part three base dune messiah better less battl book use crutch if want see bunch peopl bare know anyth stab hour thi movi if your look contempl sprawl scifi tackl interest subject matter best look elsewher
"For me Part One was the best movie of the past years and I was afraid Part Two couldn't keep up with it. So I was excited but also afraid to be disappointed.

After seeing Part Two I can't tell whether Part Two is even better than Part One, but it is truly an equal masterpiece.

The visuals are overwhelming again. This time there are even outstanding scenes in black and white.

The sound is captivating and Hans Zimmer gets the blood flowing again. This gives the scenes in almost complete silence a special meaning.

The storybuilding is also remarkable. You can really see the characters' development and also increasing tension between them.

All in all this movie is the epitome of filmmaking. After almost 3 hours I still didn't want it to end.

"From start to finish I was enthralled by the visual experience! Emotionally I was engaged. I was immersed in the world of Dune and I definitely want this story to continue to be told through the next book. Denis Villenueve has to be at the helm if they make more. The cinematography by Greg Frazier is awe inspiring. The acting is phenomenal. Hans Zimmer killed it with the score. When the movie ended I was not ready to be done. I wanted more. It was a glorious cinematic experience.

Knowing the book material and growing up with the 1984 movie, my only hang ups are on some of the choices of what was left out or changed. I know not everything can fit into the movie but I'm still digesting the changes. Like I said it was an enthralling experience and in some ways they found a very stripped down way of portraying just enough that I'm not disappointed. But I want more!

"Coming into this film, I had the highest expectations. Leaving this film, my expectations were somehow surpassed. The characters, plot, action, cinematography, sound design; every aspect of this film was finely tuned to perfection. Every scene is masterfully crafted, ingrained in my brain. The fight scenes were as tense and thrilling as the Dune Part 1, if not more so. The dialogue was engaging, the sound effects beautiful, and the music was the perfect backdrop to each scene. The directors and writers also use silence incredibly well, providing stark contrasts to the booming bass that tends to be used in larger fights. The characters feel believable, and have their own motivations, purposes and personalities, allowing their relationships to flourish. All this without even commenting on the visuals. This film is a cinematic masterpiece, the CGI and the practical effects being stunning. The way the various worlds are portrayed is expertly done. Absolutely one of the best films I have ever watched, 10/10 would recommend.",come film i highest expect leav film expect somehow surpass the charact plot action cinematographi sound design everi aspect film fine tune perfect everi scene master craft ingrain brain the fight scene ten thrill dune part the dialogu engag sound effect beauti music perfect backdrop scene the director writer also use silenc incred well provid stark contrast boom bass tend use larger fight the charact feel believ motiv purpos person allow relationship flourish all without even comment visual thi film cinemat masterpiec cgi practic effect stun the way variou world portray expertli done absolut one best film i ever watch would recommend
"The perfect sequel to a film that sets the stage for the second part. ""Dune 2"" brings religious and political parallels that allow for a profound reflection on our own society. The cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, and acting performances are simply impeccable. I feel that each frame of this film could be used as a photograph in a museum. The fascinating and exceptional soundtrack, combined with the splendid cinematography, immerse me so deeply that I feel like I'm on Arrakis. The well-crafted screenplay ties up loose ends and continues the story in a natural and captivating way, thrilling the viewer with each passing minute. The performances of everyone involved are brilliant, with special mention to the young actor Timothée Chalamet, who portrayed an incredible role as Paul Atreides with his authoritative voice and leadership demeanor persuading everyone, including viewers. There is simply nothing to complain about in this second film; it embodies cinema at its core. ""Dune 2"" is one of the most formidable cinematic experiences of the last decades and will forever be one of the best experiences for a lover of good films. It will surely become a benchmark for sci-fi/fiction and for creating an excellent masterpiece.

"I first watched the original DUNE(1984) when I was around 10, and was a little nervous when they announced a reboot. Then I watched it, and fell in love with the beautiful set designs, the sfx, and the choreography, a long with the more faithful approach to the story. I found out afterward that a sequel was green-lit only 3 days after the first one's release, and was hyping myself up for the movie. It did not disappoint. I haven't cried in a theater since endgame, but during the final battle sequence it was too beautiful and spectacular not to, seeing a film of one of my favorite novels of all time being adapted in such an incredible way was heart wrenching to say the least.

"I'm so grateful that I had the chance to see one of my favorite book series coming to life in this astonishing way. The whole length of the movie my eyes was in tears and I had the urge to get up from my chair and get involved in the story.

The visuals and soundtrack kept me in a dreamlike state almost all the whole movie. The cast was perfect for each character. I really believe them. Special mentions to Stilgar and Feyd Rautha, I think they deserves some big rewards for their great performance.

Even if you didn't read the books, this movie will take you in a place you've never been before. Dare to take this amazing ride and go see it.

"The film enchants with its breathtaking cinematography, stirring music (I love Zimmer), and immersive sound design, constructing a vibrant cinematic universe. While the talented cast delivers commendable performances and certain scenes are genuinely captivating, I struggled to form a deep connection with the main characters, and the narrative lacked the compelling grip I anticipated. Overall, it's a commendable effort, yet it lacks the magical allure and goosebump-inducing moments. Compared to the director's previous work on Blade Runner 2049, this falls slightly short. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10.",the film enchant breathtak cinematographi stir music i love zimmer immers sound design construct vibrant cinemat univers while talent cast deliv commend perform certain scene genuin captiv i struggl form deep connect main charact narr lack compel grip i anticip overal commend effort yet lack magic allur goosebumpinduc moment compar director previou work blade runner fall slightli short id rate
"Hans Zimmer. Visually stunning. What could possibly be missing?

This story has no depth. It is Anticlimactic at its best. Not sure what everyone is raving about. This story is so dull and boring with characters you care nothing about. They are shallow and lifeless. They might as well have been cardboard cutouts. They're not convincing and there is no feeling. It is literally 3 hours of visually and musically stunning footage. If that's your thing then I guess it's a great movie.

Unfortunately for me, I like a good story. I like characters who reach into my heart and my mind. I like to be convinced they're the real deal. This was so disappointing I wish I could get my money and three hours of my life back. I hoped this second part would at least make up for the long driven out part of part one, but it is just more of the same.

Where is the love between Channi and Paul? The only one who did any acting was Rebecca Ferguson, and she over-acted so much I was almost convinced she was trying to make up for the lack of depth in everyone else. Yet, Lady Jessica is supposed to be stoic. It's the director's vision, I suppose-mix it up so it comes across fresh.

Speaking of fresh. How anticlimactic was that great uprising? I don't want to give anything away, but wow! Way to work your audience up for a surprise like that! I sure as heck didn't see that coming. I sneeze faster than that.

I really have no idea how this load of garbage got so many rave reviews. It was terrible. Save yourself the money. Read the books or watch David Lynch's version.

"I watched the first Dune film shortly before Dune 2 was released and was instantly hooked by the story but seeing Dune 2 in IMAX was honestly the greatest sensory cinema experience ever! The score, the cinematography, the rhythmic editing, the acting - all just fantastic. I wasn't a sci-fi person before but this film MADE me a fan! It was the best movie by far I've seen at cinema in a long time. I would watch this film again and again and again.

"Not since Lord of the Rings have I been so enthralled by a movie I couldn't wait until I was able to review it.

The acting, the story telling, the scenery, the philosophies and human nature. It's so encapsulating I was catching myself being so immersed I forgot I was watching a movie.

The continuation of Paul Atreides' story happens at a perfect pace. New characters are introduced in a way that makes you care just enough about them to make it impactful. The telling of the stories of the Bene Gesserit is done masterfully, conveying stuff from the book that is hard to put on screen.

If there was one thing I was missing, it's the use of the word ""holy war"" instead of the book accurate ""Holy Jihad"". But I suppose that's just something they have to change.

"I don't normally write any reviews. But this I feel I must.

Wathced this movie at twilight hours (only time I can get my hands on) in BFI IMAX.

Watching movies for over 40 years and I have to say this is probably one of my best cinema experiences ever.

Just simply wow. WOW WOW WOW.

I loved every minute of it. Its so powerful. I think this director gained enough experience to make something exceptional.

I have not read the books so I can't say if it stayed true or not but it doesn't matter to me. The whole sequal is so entralling than the first (of course I do like the first part). The pace was spot on. Didn't feel the movie was long in anyway.

Soudtrack super especiall in BFI Imax as it made my blood pounding as it did with the movie.

Intense experience and in the end while I was walking to the car I told my son at no stage in the movie that I felt anything was cheesy or forced.

Again this movie is not pervect but the flaws arent big enough that you can't look past them. All the actors did an amazing job and even the beckground characters did there all. The music in the movie was one of my favourite parst because it fits perfectly in to the world and help you get immersed even more. I think that the languages where implemented really well to the point where i can see it being an actual language. Like i said this movie is not pervet it has its flaws i feel like a lot of the ideas could have been explored more and i wish we could have seen more ot the desert an the south of Arrakis.

"I found myself on numerous occasions during the film sat open mouthed and mesmerised like a 4 year old boy. I came out wanting to watch it again and again. I'm known to not get excited by anything but this had my neck hairs stood to attention frequently.

Anyone who says this film is a slow starter really doesn't know what they are talking about. The casting was spot on and they actors delivered and some.

It reminded me as a 7 year old watching Star Wars for the first time at the cinema with my mum I was that enthralled with the whole experience.

"What an intense ride this movie was! The story along the world building, acting and score drew me in from minute 1. This is what I loved about the first one and this is what I loved about this sequel! I would even say that this sequel was even more intense, more epic than the first one.

Denis Villeneuve already has proven to me that he is a great SciFi director with Blade Runner: 2049 and Arrival but with Dune he shows that he is one of the greatest for me!

If you liked Dune or SciFi in general, I think you have to watch this movie!

"Just got back from the cinema after watching this masterpiece. This and the first part are the only two films I've paid the mortgage to go and see in a large screen and they absolutely need and deserve to be seen. This takes all of the expectations I had from the first part of Dune and exceeded them ten-fold. There are some decisions made by Denis Villeneuve which are so jaw droppingly exquisite I'm not sure exactly how his announced rendition of Dune Messiah is going to have any room left to improve upon this. This is a beautiful beautiful film which builds on itself, and special mention must go to the sound design which literally shook my seat in the cinema.

As with the first you leave your seat crying I want more...more...more!!!! So very very good. One of my favourite things about the film is the belief in all the characters.

OK so. I have been a Dune fan most of my life having read the book when I was little. Played the computer game. Watched the film. Re read the book before the films came out. Even read some of the later books but gave up on them and none stand up to the first book. Albeit children of dune is wothba read. Its really refreshing to have a movie improve on a book. OK they have not stuck to the plot 100 percent and are obviously planning a war of the great houses etc. Overall its everything I have ever wanted from Sci fi and cannot thank the people who have made this work so well enough. Seriously good. Bring on the next one. I really hope they can keep this up.,ok i dune fan life read book i littl play comput game watch film re read book film came even read later book gave none stand first book albeit child dune wothba read it realli refresh movi improv book ok stuck plot percent obvious plan war great hous etc overal everyth i ever want sci fi cannot thank peopl made work well enough serious good bring next one i realli hope keep
"For transparency, I had no intention of writing a review. I read the books and loved the first movie so I had a feeling I'd like the 2nd film. And I loved it. But what really had me wanting to contribute is the 1 star reviews. I love them so much. So much anger and vitriol over a movie. Everything I loved about this move seems to be what they hate. It was long but thick with character development. The fight scenes were there for the plot only and didn't make me fall asleep to 30 mins of cgi superhero action. Instead it furthers the plot. It wasn't action packed but layers of lore and story building.

But the rage from the reviews of slow action, boring characters, ""lame"" sci-fi makes me laugh and worry. This is epic storytelling, not force fed action. You will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time. If you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch, you don't be disappointed. Obviously not for everyone but what is. But one of the best film (franchises) I've seen in years. Truly hoping to see the full arch of Paul's story with a 3rd.",for transpar i intent write review i read book love first movi i feel id like nd film and i love but realli want contribut star review i love much so much anger vitriol movi everyth i love move seem hate it long thick charact develop the fight scene plot didnt make fall asleep min cgi superhero action instead further plot it wasnt action pack layer lore stori build but rage review slow action bore charact lame scifi make laugh worri thi epic storytel forc fed action you attent span focu minut time if break cycl need non stop stimul instead melt rich deep stori world build charact arch dont disappoint obvious everyon but one best film franchis ive seen year truli hope see full arch paul stori rd
"What an absolute masterpiece.

The one thing that's important for me when I watch a movie is the ability of the filmmaker to make you watch the movie without blinking, and I have some regrets for blinking my eyes. I missed so many great seconds of the movie because I couldn't keep my eyes open for almost 3 hours. But if I have to choose a movie and have the ability to watch it without blinking, it's going to be this one.

The movie shows the masterclass of a director whose movies do not fail you.

I think this franchise shows the best work of the new generation of actors alongside the old ones with one of the best directors.

This movie is powerful in every way. The music is outstanding, and I don't think it would have been possible without Hans Zimmer. The music is atmospheric, and it gives the audience the ability to feel the moments.

The story is phenomenal, but we have to stand up and praise Denis Villeneuve for his perfect adaptation.

And the cinematography.

I'm speechless. It's something only for the eyes, and I can't describe it with words.

At the end, it's the perfect movie made for cinemas, and it defines the word cinema with it.

Denis Villeneuve is at his peak.",what absolut masterpiec the one thing that import i watch movi abil filmmak make watch movi without blink i regret blink eye i miss mani great second movi i couldnt keep eye open almost hour but i choos movi abil watch without blink go one the movi show masterclass director whose movi fail i think franchis show best work new gener actor alongsid old one one best director thi movi power everi way the music outstand i dont think would possibl without han zimmer the music atmospher give audienc abil feel moment the stori phenomen stand prais deni villeneuv perfect adapt and cinematographi im speechless it someth eye i cant describ word at end perfect movi made cinema defin word cinema deni villeneuv peak
"As I watched Dune Part Two, I had an increasingly sinking feeling. Oh no. What have they done? Changing things when adapting a book is expected. Different mediums need different approaches. But the changes need to make sense. Things I think are core to Dune are missing from Part Two. New things added don't work as well. I won't list anything here due to spoilers. I'll maybe blog about it in a few weeks. Maybe not. It certainly looks great, and I rated it 6/10 for that. Not for characters and story. You should see it, but be prepared if you know the book.

I can easily say that at this point Dune part 2 is the most representative movie of all the art of Denis Villeneuve, it contains a lot of ispiration from 2001: a space odyssey and also from his pasts films like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival. He did a perfect sequel for the first film that was also on point, but this one is more strong and we can see the beauty of the character and story development that leave us with the need of another sequel.

"Going fresh from finishing Dune part two, I'll let this be a continuation of my review of part one.

It's visually a very amusing movie, starts of fresh, with at least some amount of story.

The expectations are high (compared to 2/10 I gave part one). And they keep being high, for like 3/4 of the movie.

And at that point you start giving up. You realize there's no big reveal coming. Nothing unexpected, or at least resembling a story that evolves.

When I've been so critical in part one, mainly because of the huge cliffhanger it ends on, my friend said: ""just you wait for part two""

Well I did, and I still can't see the appeal.

0/5 for a movie that tried, but was over hyped, and a proof that you can't turn a bad book into a good movie.",go fresh finish dune part two ill let continu review part one it visual amus movi start fresh least amount stori the expect high compar i gave part one and keep high like movi and point start give you realiz there big reveal come noth unexpect least resembl stori evolv when ive critic part one mainli huge cliffhang end friend said wait part two well i i still cant see appeal movi tri hype proof cant turn bad book good movi
"A great film that delves deeper into the characters, and more of a study piece here with our Characters. Who are wonderfully portrayed inside this film, I always new how talented the likes of Timothee S and Zendaya were, who arguably had there best performance here [Timothee Chalamet), although haven't seen Wonka.

The futuristic style of the film is wonderful, so gorgeous and astetically pleasing on the eye. The effects are very good inside this film, and it's used effectively with the long range photographic image. So many wide shots which are tremendous, and as said look wonderful.

And the film delves more into the human body and it makes it more interesting. Certainly the power elements with the 'revenge' plot which is a good way to expand the world and are characters, and makes Dune Part 2 great. There's some political aspects here, but for me it didn't drag the film down.

And the length of Dune 2 is perfect. The pacing of this film is also very good, it never feels like it's dragged out at any point in time, I was always entertained and I think it's a captivating sequal that should not be ignored. It's also a perfect world that projects imagery and some great use of colour and effect. Makes it a great fun film to watch, If you liked the first part, I strongly suggest you watch this one. Because it's even better!

"This is the best theater experience I've had in a long time, maybe ever. There was an insane amount of hype behind this movie and I think it was worth every bit. Denis really did that. An impossible adaptation.

Did not feel like 3 hours. Just as with I watched the first movie, it was hitting its third act and I felt I'd only been watching for an hour, I didn't want it to end.

"Denis Villeneuve has set a new standard for how Sci Fi movies should be adapted and directed. There are few things to nitpick. Mostly to do with timeline and character transition. But when you understand it is being adapted to screen, it is near impossible to show a timeline which happens over few years. The art design, cinematography, vfx will set new gold standards. The cast and acting was stellar with a sprinkle of humour from Javier Bardem. Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken all were stellar as the new characters. Caught it at the Sunday Fan First Premiere.

"""Dune 2"" continues the epic saga with breathtaking visuals and a gripping storyline. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, it delves deeper into the intricate politics and rich lore of the Dune universe. The performances are stellar, particularly from the talented ensemble cast led by Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. The film masterfully balances spectacle with substance, delivering intense action sequences alongside thought-provoking themes of power, destiny, and sacrifice.

"Too much hype hurts even the best movies. There are a bunch of fanboys out there who will fall drooling to the ground when they see a large scale CG battle in a scifi movie. They don't care if there is a plot or character development. Just seeing the pew pews will get them going.

This is a good movie and it owes its strength to its incredible predecessor. But in the second installment lost are the sound design, the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in - that made you ""live"" the movie. Villeneuve, having spent 3 hours in Dune:Part 1 building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole Part 2 to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequels.

There is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot. Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.

Character development is lost here. While he allows the young Atreides to mature a little and discover himself, he quickly turns Stilgar into an almost comical, caricaturized fanatic. While trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarily.

The visual design is beautiful to behold as ever. May be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them, the impact is less but still there.

The sound was one of the strongest aspects of Part 1. Somehow I feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue. And I think it is a great loss.

Conclusion to my rant: By any standard this is a good movie. Worthy of a glowing 7 or 7.5 score. However compared to what it could have been, it unfortunately falls short.

"Movie is dense, alive, intense, the plot feels inevitable but not predictable. I know this sounds like I'm just throwing words out, but this is the kind of movie that makes you really sit and realize the power film as a medium can have.

I remembered the first one enough, but I'm not a Dune superfan or anything. After watching this one though I feel like I should just watch them back to back to really soak it in. The glimpses of the inner politics (and of otherworldly things) is downright fascinating. Battle choreography fantastic, setpieces, fantastic.

The only negatives I can think of is one particularly bad cgi wide shot which stuck out because everything else is immaculate, as well as one line from Chalamet that did not meet the quality of the performance of the veteran actor he said it to. (Maybe he felt he has to act up to him?l Anyways, great stuff, I'll see you all when Part 3 comes out in 2030.",movi den aliv intens plot feel inevit predict i know sound like im throw word kind movi make realli sit realiz power film medium i rememb first one enough im dune superfan anyth after watch one though i feel like i watch back back realli soak the glimps inner polit otherworldli thing downright fascin battl choreographi fantast setpiec fantast the neg i think one particularli bad cgi wide shot stuck everyth el immacul well one line chalamet meet qualiti perform veteran actor said mayb felt act himl anyway great stuff ill see part come
"This really isn't a Dune-the-book movie but a related tale that takes away all the sci-fi and deep intrigue that makes Dune-the-book such a fascinating tale. Instead what we get is super-stylized black-and-white with the details and the context rendered nearly superfluous in order to propel a simple tale of political ascension. Why is spice so important in use and action? What's the background that has set this whole conflict in motion? What's big deal about the worms? Why is Paul so reliant on the myths spread to ""pave the way"" versus his own abilities? Is Paul something special or not? Surely you've seen Dune I, now finding its natural continuation in Dune II which furthers the cause of gorgeous special effects, environmentals, sound, etc. But somehow it's all bland and as colorless as much of the landscape despite the spectacular costuming. Without context it's another ho-hum story of moderate manipulation that aims to succeed via Paul's riding the coattails of religious parable and meaningless miracles via a pushy Mom. P. S. Zendaya is only marginally better in D-II but far more annoying but T. C. has really grown up and greatly compensates for the overall plot dullness.

"This is one of those films that is overrated by a whole 5 stars because people who don't get it or fall asleep blame themselves rather than the film. Their inclination is to follow the herd... or the emperor in this case. Only problem is that the emperor has no clothes. It's a cultural phenomena whereby if something seems or has the pretence of being intelligent, half the population is scared to call it out as dumb.

It's just a bunch of nonsense art-house type scenes thrown together without any particular order or purpose.. and they could do some decent CGI because, thanks to the abundance of sand, there is really very little on screen at any one time.

"**A Cinematic Triumph: Exploring the Epic Sequel ""Dune: Part Two""**

""Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor to deliver an epic saga that surpasses all expectations. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.

From the outset, it is evident that ""Dune: Part Two"" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.

Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.

At the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.

Supporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.

Yet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of ""Dune: Part Two"" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.

In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, ""Dune: Part Two"" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond.",a cinemat triumph explor epic sequel dune part two dune part two emerg cinemat tour de forc build upon foundat laid predecessor deliv epic saga surpass expect direct visionari filmmak deni villeneuv sequel transport viewer back mesmer world arraki weav tapestri intrigu betray heroism unpreced scale from outset evid dune part two labor love meticul craft unwav commit honor frank herbert icon sourc materi the film pick seamlessli predecessor left plung viewer world brink war battl control arraki intensifi one film greatest strength lie master storytel villeneuv deftli navig intric narr thread balanc exposit heartpound action keep viewer edg seat each charact given ampl room grow evolv motiv conflict explor depth nuanc whether charismat paul atreid grappl destini prophesi messiah enigmat ladi jessica torn loyalti son bene gesserit sisterhood everi charact feel fulli realiz essenti stori unfold drama visual dune part two noth short breathtak the sweep vista arraki brought life stun practic visual effect serv mesmer backdrop film epic narr from tower sandworm roam desert intric design fremen sietch everi aspect worldbuild execut meticul attent detail immers viewer univers feel fantast eerili familiar at heart film lie except ensembl cast led incompar perform timoth chalamet rebecca ferguson chalamet bring quiet intens role paul atreid captur charact intern struggl poi convict ferguson meanwhil deliv standout perform ladi jessica infus charact complex strength elev beyond typic archetyp genr support perform like oscar isaac zendaya javier bardem enrich film tapestri actor bring depth gravita respect role whether isaac portray nobl duke leto atreid bardem charismat turn fremen leader stilgar everi charact leav last impress contribut film rich immers world yet perhap remark aspect dune part two themat depth beneath epic spectacl lie poignant explor power religion consequ uncheck ambit a variou faction vie control arraki film forc viewer confront uncomfort truth human natur corrupt influenc power it time thoughtprovok commentari reson long credit roll invit viewer ponder implic action increasingli complex world in conclus dune part two stand triumphant achiev modern cinema sprawl epic dazzl sen challeng mind with master storytel breathtak visual stellar perform cement deni villeneuv statu one preemin filmmak time for fan scienc fiction cinema alik dune part two experi missedan unforgett journey heart arraki beyond
"This one is truly special! Mr. Villeneuve is delivering yet another spectacular movie, following the also very good part one. As other reviewers have mentioned, part two is more complex as we are witnessing the evolution of Paul Atreides to a fierce leader of an entire nation.

All actors bring their ""A"" game and are delivering artfully the vision of their director.

The visual and sound effects together with the cinematography is ground breaking as well. Everything is just made as it should for the viewer to be transported to the realm of Dune!

"I was lucky enough to catch the IMAX prerelease and left stunned and shocked by how good it was. The imagery created in this movie was beyond anything I had ever imagined while reading the book. The visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of Herbert's writing to focus on romance, revenge, betrayal, fundamentalism and transcendence. It is a different ride than part one. I won't provide any spoilers, but here are a few other random thoughts.

I got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special IMAX showing. I hope they start doing more of these. Hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because Dune: Part Two is an experience in IMAX that made the story better that I can't get at home. I love watching movies at home with subtitles, but I would have missed a lot visually if I focused on reading those.

I left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the IMAX technology and pace of storytelling, but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt, evil powers focused on maximizing wealth. The fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement. I'm looking forward to rereading Herbert's books again.",i lucki enough catch imax prereleas left stun shock good the imageri creat movi beyond anyth i ever imagin read book the visual storytel world build beauti condens much herbert write focu romanc reveng betray fundament transcend it differ ride part one i wont provid spoiler random thought i got kick brief genuin appreci intro record special imax show i hope start hope get movi fan back pack theater dune part two experi imax made stori better i cant get home i love watch movi home subtitl i would miss lot visual i focus read i left theater somewhat overwhelm imax technolog pace storytel also parallel current event religi fundament rebel corrupt evil power focus maxim wealth the fact movi pack much three hour achiev im look forward reread herbert book
"This movie took my breath away. Saw an early release on an IMAX screen. Just wish I could see it again and again. I was worried it might get boring because of how long it was. That was FAR from the case. I was engaged throughout the film and on the edge of my seat at multiple times. The music, the acting, the costumes, cinematography- All so so so so good.

"There's been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released. While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing ""special"" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for ""best sci fi film of all time"" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.

Definitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the ""goat"" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.

Again, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol.

Unlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...! Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP. In my book, that's the TRUE definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time.",there lot hyperbol superl movi sinc releas while solid entertain sci fi movi label goat anyth similar peopl fan mayb time live peopl prison moment far often i rememb time took someth way groundbreak movi offer call greatest sci fi movi time there realli noth special sure cinematographi strong action scene entertain there noth crazi innov film it sort paint number messiah type tale the chemistri zendaya chalamet realli good butler turn solid turn villain but outsid there noth that gonna etch movi sand time imo i rememb the matrix came see theater complet mind blown i never seen anyth like it may unfair thatll standard ill hold movi vy best sci fi film time last day film watcher thi solid movi dont buy hype temper expect youll enjoy fine definit film enjoy larg screen great surround sound the director crew set realli great look shot best enjoy larg screen with said score visual aesthet one note drab which i get part mood tone director go but steril cold not insan fun hold seat pant type film rous score get hype action that unfold have seen dune part one recent i necessarili expect movi i heard goat word thrown around rais expect wed see screen again fine film noth genr defin imo one watch youll fine lol unlik best genr cant wait rewatch where action unlik anyth youv ever seen charact rich layer likabl figur the score fun captiv even dark one you go tell everyon need watch movi asap in book that true definit film look call greatest sci fi film time
Dune Part Two is an outstanding sequel that greatly outshines Dune Part One in every single way. This film is definitely made to be seen in the cinema as the outstanding visuals translate amazingly onto the big screen. The music of this film is absolutely amazing and in my opinion it's one of the best soundtracks ever made. The story is gripping as it is fascinating and fantastic to see the rise of Paul Atreides . This film series seems to definitely be the Lord Of The Rings of the 2020s and it will be praised for generations.

"A brilliant cinema experience, every bit as good as Dune Part 1. Incredible visuals and outstanding sound design create an immersive and frighteningly real world. Sci-fi has rarely looked or sounded better.

However, in terms of story the movie somehow felt long yet condensed/rushed at the same time. Scenes seemed to move from one to the next because the story needed to move on, not being driven by character or emotion. Some relationships felt underdeveloped, and the story progression at times felt incohesive (like someone accidentally pressed the ""skip to next chapter"" button and you feel like you've missed something).

A very good movie - visually and acoustically perfect - but with some story and pacing issues that had it fall short of total perfection, for me.",a brilliant cinema experi everi bit good dune part incred visual outstand sound design creat immers frighteningli real world scifi rare look sound better howev term stori movi somehow felt long yet condensedrush time scene seem move one next stori need move driven charact emot some relationship felt underdevelop stori progress time felt incohes like someon accident press skip next chapter button feel like youv miss someth a good movi visual acoust perfect stori pace issu fall short total perfect
"It's the worst movie I've watched in a long time.

If someone who never saw a previous 1984 film or read a novel watches this one would not understand a thing because there is no logical explanation between some of the events like when Paul's sister appeared all of a sudden and no explanation how or why. The movie itsef is very slow and boring.

The main actor looks like a whiney teen aristocrat instead of a strong young man. Even physically he doesn't look like someone who can stand a real fight or lead the whole nation.

In the novel Paul Atreides is extremely disciplined and confident in every thing he does. All of his actions and words are deliberate and precisely controlled, and it is this that makes him the super human being - Kwisatz Haderaca. The spice awakens his abilities but doesn't transform him into someone else.

Total waste of money and time.",it worst movi ive watch long time if someon never saw previou film read novel watch one would understand thing logic explan event like paul sister appear sudden explan the movi itsef slow bore the main actor look like whiney teen aristocrat instead strong young man even physic doesnt look like someon stand real fight lead whole nation in novel paul atreid extrem disciplin confid everi thing all action word deliber precis control make super human kwisatz haderaca the spice awaken abil doesnt transform someon el total wast money time

Go see part 2 in theaters March 1st! Austin performance captivating, outstanding, menacing, creepy, and will having you want to see his performance even more. Also Austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was Tex Waston and more I feel like both are kind of equal but Austin in dune was insane and I would love to watch it over again.

"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.

As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.

Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.

In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.

The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.

I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.

Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.",had pleasur watch film earli screen complet blown away a big fan game throne franchis long time sinc ive encount level worldbuild epic would highli recommend rewatch first movi order appreci subtleti foreshadow better though complet necessari sinc movi pretti selfcontain would plea gener audienc watch first movi year ago well deni villeneuv continu prove one promis filmmak time i would keep highbudget epic tale sinc director work today tackl genr good in person opinion movi better first part pretti much everi aspect han zimmer score master youd expect one step oscar winner grammi nomin score pt technic aspect vfx product design sound edit etc are top notch awardsworthi the action sequenc absolut mind blow sent chill spine deni direct impecc stori absolut fascin continu develop charact pt even deeper introduc new incred intrigu charact the movi serv great wrapup stori introduc pt howev opinion could serv even better setup possibl masterpiec dune messiah i realli hope get greenlit soon i believ sure hope movi major player next award season belowthelin win pretti much guarante right i hope get love abovethelin categori direct even best pictur perhap break stigma present again fantasyscifi genr recent year academi a big fan genr unless better competitor releas later elig period perhap time movi like triumph dont miss opportun catch movi imax sinc i believ histor piec epicfantasyscifi cinema movi rememb classic genr
"Just finished DUNE 2 with my son and I feel validated. This is the movie that we have waiting over 50 years to be made. Everything about was exactly as it should have been. Villenueve gave it the scale that it needed, while still making EVERY character fully fleshed out. Film making technology finally got to the point that could bring this story to life, and Denis Villenueve was there with his vision. I can only imagine Frank Herbert looking down from Heaven with a smile of approval.

And 75% of the audience seemed to be older bald guys. They finally made one for the guys who were book nerds in the 70-80's.",just finish dune son i feel valid thi movi wait year made everyth exactli villenuev gave scale need still make everi charact fulli flesh film make technolog final got point could bring stori life deni villenuev vision i imagin frank herbert look heaven smile approv and audienc seem older bald guy they final made one guy book nerd

The second one is more action, more pacy, woth fabulous charactersiations, part 1 was great but 2 is even so much better. I loved the funny delivery, many people laughed outloud in the cinema. Also the acting, the scenery, the music. A masterpiece. I also loved that there weren't prolonged sequences of fights or anything, in a way it's a movie of vignettes that are well executed, well conected and make logical and easy to follow story. And I speak it as a person that has not read the series. Finally, when I realised it's already the second part of the film and we are nearing the end, all I was able to think was, it's going to be a looooong wait for part 3.

"Whether your a fan of the novels, or the 80's version, Dune is truly à work of art. The scenery was breathtaking and in regards to acting it was clear the actors have embraced and portrayed their characters to à T in direct correlation to the novel they are portrayed in the most perfect way. I admit I was weary before watching because the first one was just incredible .. but this does not dissapoint, I can only think of 2 other movies in history where the sequel outshined or performed on the same level of the first part and that would either be T2 jugement day,and of course the godfather 2. These titles are renowned and beloved by all, and quite Frankly that's the direction The Dune Saga has broughtforth, your left glued to the scream and asking what? I'm gonna have to wait another 3 years ... what if I don't live that long... Even if you haven't seen the first film, one can pick up and follow along as long as they pay attention to the narrative and direction the film is going in. Because the final showdown does not dissapoint and as I said prior.. Why do I have to wait another 3 years and here I am writing my commentary before healing to work and buying another ticket to see it on the big screen again this evening.

"I went in with high expectations and they were surpassed. Saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser. Sound design/score and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way I've never experienced. I'm at a bit of a loss for words other than generational, masterpiece, theatrical cinematic experience like nothing I've witnessed before. Loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material. What's so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation. You experience the story from the mind of the character. In the film, the dialogue is there to support the film, which is primary here. The visuals, the cinematography, the sound, the score are all the story, and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that. It's so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story.

Well done. Still riding the high.

I wouldn't say it's an adult film and main characters had more of a high-school teenie bop feel .. hard to believe as an adult those 2 were warriors or leaders .. supporting cast was amazing except Christopher Walken sounded like he stepped out of a newyork deli in the 1940s zero clue how that wasn't supposed to stick out everyone had different accents and his was outrageous ..,while i say vibrant visual captiv also well done soundtrack howev stori dull act i didnt find believ similar budget day time soap overal pretti good i wouldnt say adult film main charact highschool teeni bop feel hard believ adult warrior leader support cast amaz except christoph walken sound like step newyork deli zero clue wasnt suppos stick everyon differ accent outrag
"This is just my opinion: the new Dune remakes are heartless pieces. The CGI and visuals, costumes, soundtrack, and everything is visually appealing, but wrong place wrong time to make this movie. Especially with everything happening in the Middle East.

The acting was bland.

These movies have no heart behind them. They are visually appealing and that is it. I don't get anything from these films; nothing about them sticks with me, and I truly believe (as a ND movie buff with an animation degree) these films will die in the year they were made.

They're just like the Marvels films- fun/entertaining to see in theaters and will hype you up until the week after and the trend dies and everyone forgets and never speaks about it till the next one comes up.

David Lynchs Dune is better and is more memorable, and has more art and heart in it.",thi opinion new dune remak heartless piec the cgi visual costum soundtrack everyth visual appeal wrong place wrong time make movi especi everyth happen middl east the act bland these movi heart behind they visual appeal i dont get anyth film noth stick i truli believ nd movi buff anim degre film die year made theyr like marvel film funentertain see theater hype week trend die everyon forget never speak till next one come david lynch dune better memor art heart
"Dune: part two is the continuation of the already excellent Dune: part one, and I'm so happy to say that this movie is insane. I really think this movie is amazing in every aspect.

Starting with the world building, this was my favorite aspect from the first movie, and this movie builds further on that in such excellence, and in combination with the astounding cinematography I really felt like I was there on arrakis. You will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating. I'm still in shock and I want to go back.

All the performance are also so good. The story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great, especially Austin Butler! His performance makes his character truely scary, such a good villain. Timothee Chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things Paul is going thru this movie, which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold. The same goes for all the other actors, I just can't say there was a lesser performance, everyone really gave there all and it shows!

Also, the score is (again) incredibly good! Hans Zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie, which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher level.

In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, it starts slower, but that's a good thing. It needs that, so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes I have ever seen! I'm really still in awe, and I could keep talking about how great everything is, but believe me, just watch the movie. Go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it. You will be blown away, this is really one of the best films of the generation. Thank you, Dennis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this movie, and I'll eagerly be waiting for Dune: Messiah!

Long live the fighters!

After I read the amazing reviews I kept my expectations low for not being disappointed. It was blow minding. If this movie won't receive an Oscar for best cinematography The Oscar can be cancelled. All actors are amazing but Timothee deserves an Oscar. After seeing him in Wonka and then in this I think he is the most versatile actor at this time. Same thing about Austin. You won't recognise him here. Zendaya interprets one of the most powerful and badass female characters of all time in the most amazing way and she is perfect. Love her. There is no one bad thing I can say about this movie. But I think we need more kind of these movies. Don't miss it for anything in the world and by the way the IMAX really worth it.,after i read amaz review i kept expect low disappoint it blow mind if movi wont receiv oscar best cinematographi the oscar cancel all actor amaz timothe deserv oscar after see wonka i think versatil actor time same thing austin you wont recognis zendaya interpret one power badass femal charact time amaz way perfect love there one bad thing i say movi but i think need kind movi dont miss anyth world way imax realli worth
"I had the pleasure of watching this movie yesterday at the Swedish premiere and oh man was a mesmerized by the beauty of it all!

Being honest, I instantly fell in love with part one and I have probably watched it more times than what would be deemed sane, or healthy.

So, watching part two was a no brainer to me and needless to say, my expectations where very high.

As the credits rolled I didn't want to leave my seat. Denis Villeneuve did it again. He blew my mind.

He portrayed the world of Dune in a way I didn't believe was possible. Everything is cinematically grandiose and glues you to your seat in awe.

The sci-fi elements of Dune are out of this world, not since the release of the first Star Wars have I seen so many innovative solutions to visualise it. Everything from the Harkonnen desert suits to the mortar ships are things never seen before that excites the mind. This paired up with the amazing sound effects offers a cinematic experience like no other.

The movie itself, the storytelling, pacing and the acting is stellar. No complaints at all.

I might be biased but this is a must for anyone that enjoys sci-fi.

"Dune: Part 2 not only surpasses the first film but elevates it, not many films are able to achieve such feat.

Hans Zimmer returns and somehow outdoes himself bringing us a score that rattles you in your seat, memorable epic and somewhat melancholy.

Greig Fraser returns, and just like Hans Zimmer he outdoes himself, memorable cinematography that will be imprinted in my head for a long time. The use of color is sublime, the black and white scene is incredible job well done.

The performances are all incredible. Zendaya is the true stand out, but Timothée Chalamet is phenomenal, He speaks with such conviction and power This young man is gonna have an incredible career, his acting range is absurd! But the likes of Christopher waltz, Florence Pugh, Javier Bardem are all great! But let's not forget Austin freaking Butler delivering a villainess performance that will be remembered for the ages, menacing, cruel, brutal. The introduction to this character is perfect. You hate him, but you love him.

This film doesn't shy away from politics and how it's used is so relevant to todays time, and it also doesn't shy away from the manipulation of politics and manipulation of power and Messiah like figures. It dives deep into religion and It's not afraid to show how it affects the characters.

There truly is so much that happens in this film and it's done almost perfectly. I can't think of a flaw. I sat through the whole credits roll and I never do that. I was just speechless with this film. The third act is of the likes of The Two Towers, of the likes of Empire Strikes Back!.

None of this would've been achieved without Denis Villeneuve, this man is putting together a resume that stands up to some of the greatest film makers to ever do it! His direction in this film is sublime there's a scene towards the end, where they specifically choose not to use the score and you feel the intensity of the fight on screen and it's powerful.

"Hands down the best theater experience of my life. I loved Dune Part One so much but Part Two was on another level. Everything was absolutely perfect. I can not find one thing that bothered me whatsoever in this film. You can tell everyone that worked on the film knew they were making something that will be remembered for decades, and it shows.

The acting, set pieces, score and costume design are all as good as it can get. There were many moments where the cgi was so good that I honestly couldn't tell if it was practical or not. I just finished reading the first book before seeing this and while there was a lot of stuff left out or changed, I had no issue with it. Even my father who was not a fan of Part One said this is a great film. I hate using the term masterpiece because it is used so much nowadays but Dune Part Two is monumental masterpiece.",hand best theater experi life i love dune part one much part two anoth level everyth absolut perfect i find one thing bother whatsoev film you tell everyon work film knew make someth rememb decad show the act set piec score costum design good get there mani moment cgi good i honestli couldnt tell practic i finish read first book see lot stuff left chang i issu even father fan part one said great film i hate use term masterpiec use much nowaday dune part two monument masterpiec
"I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here. A big thank you to AMC Theatres and WB for the opportunity to experience this in IMAX tonight. I highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience.

"So for his final trial the soon-to-be Messiah has to traverse the desert coming across all sorts of dangers as explained to him thoroughly by Stilgar. ""Beware of the small ones, they are the most dangerous."" And off he goes, right? No! Instead: Cut to him walking alongside Chani in the dunes. Next scene he's with the fremens again. What happened here? Clearly some scenes are missing. Worse... it's never explained how he dealt with the trial.

Besides that, there's a lot of build-up, over two hours, to a somewhat epic conclusion that is much too brief. And the main battle looked like it was lifted from Star Wars Attack of the Clones, only with better CGI.

"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or have missed a dose, as I cannot comprehend the high praise for this sequel.

I adored Part 1, which introduced me to this trippy Sci-Fi and the grandeur of a far-flung potential future.

Part 2 was all spectacle, yelling, and repetition (we get it, he's the chosen one), marred by:

poor editing (I'm genuinely shocked they didn't start the film on Giedi Prime with that battle sequence. Beginning it there would have pulled us in to this weird SciFi world and made it clear that there was some horrific villain who would be a huge threat to Paul and his ambitions, instead we got a slow paced intro about returning a dead body. Dull)

Lackluster pacing (yes, there's a lot to cover, but the narrative swings between too much happening and sudden lulls, or a weird build-up to a climax that kind of just happens out of nowhere - bang - and it's done).

The lead, Timothee, falls short of charisma (he's genuinely trying, but he seems miscast)

The romance feels totally unconvincing (almost as bad as that romance in Attack of the Clones).

The villain, despite a cool appearance, lacks depth. Yes, he's psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that, but he's not scary or threatening.

Maybe I need to watch it again, but I was disappointed for sure, and I don't really know if it's just me missing something or if everyone's expectations of good films are being watered down, and we're forgetting that good movies get under your skin, whereas this one barely made a scratch.",i feel like im take crazi pill miss dose i cannot comprehend high prais sequel i ador part introduc trippi scifi grandeur farflung potenti futur part spectacl yell repetit get he chosen one mar poor edit im genuin shock didnt start film giedi prime battl sequenc begin would pull u weird scifi world made clear horrif villain would huge threat paul ambit instead got slow pace intro return dead bodi dull lacklust pace ye there lot cover narr swing much happen sudden lull weird buildup climax kind happen nowher bang done the lead timothe fall short charisma he genuin tri seem miscast the romanc feel total unconvinc almost bad romanc attack clone the villain despit cool appear lack depth ye he psychot need constantli look beneath furrow hairless brow show u he scari threaten mayb i need watch i disappoint sure i dont realli know miss someth everyon expect good film water forget good movi get skin wherea one bare made scratch
"A love story to the original trilogy.

This is how you make a movie out of a book, for all future movie makers out there. While there are divergencies from the books, it thematically follows and still captures the heart of the corruption of power, religion, ecological transformation, ethics, war and violence that Frank Herbert played on in his masterpiece. The multiple shots, sometimes only a few seconds, that paid tribute to conversations and interplay within the books was excellent. I wish they had had time to include the full story given how beautifully choregraphed each scene is, but its already almost 3 hours and somethings just have to be cut.

It impressively does all this while still spending enough time on character building and capturing the ""plan within a plan within a plan."" Just well done, I hope there will be an extended trilogy cut in the future. Perhaps someone will even make the sequels/prequels in the future.",a love stori origin trilog thi make movi book futur movi maker while diverg book themat follow still captur heart corrupt power religion ecolog transform ethic war violenc frank herbert play masterpiec the multipl shot sometim second paid tribut convers interplay within book excel i wish time includ full stori given beauti choregraph scene alreadi almost hour someth cut it impress still spend enough time charact build captur plan within plan within plan just well done i hope extend trilog cut futur perhap someon even make sequelsprequel futur

It is all pure magic and so beautiful to watch. The dynamics of power, beliefs and the environment makes the backdrop for the plot so captivating. The movie was so magical that I completely lost track of time, and thus feared that the movie would suddenly end, because I could not get enough of it. The movie was everything it needed to be and was a perfect adaptation that will probably become one of my all time favorites.",i instant goosebump run bodi time i count it absolut thrill watch everyth care execut music visual it pure magic beauti watch the dynam power belief environ make backdrop plot captiv the movi magic i complet lost track time thu fear movi would suddenli end i could get enough the movi everyth need perfect adapt probabl becom one time favorit
"Never before have I been this excited for the release of a film. When the delay from November to March for Part Two's release happened, it devastated me. But now it is here. I was able to see it almost a week early and it did not disappoint. I am an avid fan of the books, so I will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen, but at the same time, most if not all, of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final product.

The cinematography once again is stunning. The gorgeous sands of Arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day, the larger than life presence of the sandworms, the dismal and brutal gray of Giedi Prime, the various sietches and places of the Fremen. All of it looks gorgeous. The Hanz Zimmer score returning, capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet. Loved all of it.

The performances of characters evolve, most notably Timothee as he becomes Paul Muadib and Lady Jessica as she takes on role of Reverend Mother. Zendaya as Chani gives much-needed depth to that character from the book, Javier as Stilgar was incredible. Each performance was fantastic. Dave Bautista also shines in his role as Beast Rabban. I could go on and on about each performance, but another well done aspect of this film.

If you enjoyed Dune Part One in any capacity and long to see where the story of Paul Atreides and the Harkonnens goes from here, you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the world-building from Part One makes it all pay off here.

So many scenes from this Part Two took my breath away and I think Denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story, despite several changes from the source material. I will definitely see this film again and again, so I can relive this incredible cinematic experience and if you haven't already, definitely give the books a try, and I look forward to the next chapter: DUNE MESSIAH.",never i excit releas film when delay novemb march part two releas happen devast but i abl see almost week earli disappoint i avid fan book i say critic slight complaint come wish see scene charact book adapt screen time chang make better pace probabl less clutter final product the cinematographi stun the gorgeou sand arraki mix color differ time day larger life presenc sandworm dismal brutal gray giedi prime variou sietch place fremen all look gorgeou the hanz zimmer score return captur perfectli atmospher desert planet love the perform charact evolv notabl timothe becom paul muadib ladi jessica take role reverend mother zendaya chani give muchneed depth charact book javier stilgar incred each perform fantast dave bautista also shine role beast rabban i could go perform anoth well done aspect film if enjoy dune part one capac long see stori paul atreid harkonnen goe definit enjoy film pace feel quick action pack worldbuild part one make pay so mani scene part two took breath away i think deni incred job adapt second half epic stori despit sever chang sourc materi i definit see film i reliv incred cinemat experi havent alreadi definit give book tri i look forward next chapter dune messiah

"Contrasts with Marvel and Star Wars in that it takes itself completely seriously. There is no humor, which allows the intensity to build and lets the world building be immersive. Similar in some ways to Batman movies like The Batman or The Dark Knight.

It was a nice experience, I gave it a 10 because asking for more from a movie is unreasonable.

Very fast paced, similar to Infinity War, full of action. There isn't much in the way of day to day scenes. At 2:45 hr I don't see any way around that in 1 movie.

The Chosen One motif seems well suited to cinema since it allows telling a big story while following one man, but it's definitely disconnected from reality.",contrast marvel star war take complet serious there humor allow intens build let world build immers similar way batman movi like the batman the dark knight it nice experi i gave ask movi unreason veri fast pace similar infin war full action there isnt much way day day scene at hr i dont see way around movi the chosen one motif seem well suit cinema sinc allow tell big stori follow one man definit disconnect realiti
"Dune Part 2 as a film by itself was incredible. The vfx were amazing. The plot was really good. The acting was stellar. The cinematography. Everything was really well done.

However, after about and hour and a half into the film, some major changes from the book started to become clear and egregious. As someone who read the book, I was quite disappointed by some of these changes.

However, for anyone who has not read the book, this film should be an amazing experience and story.

Despite my grievances, this movies was still incredible. I would recommend this film to those who read the book as well, just watch it expecting some relatively sizable changes. Really good movie, especially in theater.

"I was really looking forward to this and while it was good, I wasn't blown away. I question some of the casting (Christopher Walken really?) and the sense of timing / pace seemed off. A lot was not explained well and I felt it skipped around too much and spent too much time on atmospheric moments when a bit more story building was called for. Even the iconic moment of riding the sandworm seemed a bit rush and then when the moment arrived it was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, visually appealing and great technical work. But the story which was written by a grand master of Science Fiction was given short shift. Hard to believe that in an almost 3 hour movie a lot of what made Dune great was given rudimentary mention or skipped all together. Whats with the hype ""Anna Taylor Joy"" she had a what 15 second clip. A lot of skilled actors barely had any screen time or fulfilling character arcs. More good have been done. I liked it but I've read the books multiple times. Someone with no history of the books would likely be confused.

"The visual and auditory spectacle is brilliant. But dune is about the journey of self realization. The central core of Dune is around the sleeper must awaken dialogue which is not captured in both parts. Only David Lynch's movie captures that essence.

I would urge everyone to watch David Lynch version before this.

Also, some scenes are very anticlimatic. Certain characters have been downpoured into something they are not as seen in part one. Some scenes have been elongated way too much and some scenes requiring more context have been cut short.

Dune book series is an epic. An epic needs nurturing of all characters. Even if the movie is nurturing only the central character, the essence of the character is missing.",the visual auditori spectacl brilliant but dune journey self realiz the central core dune around sleeper must awaken dialogu captur part onli david lynch movi captur essenc i would urg everyon watch david lynch version also scene anticlimat certain charact downpour someth seen part one some scene elong way much scene requir context cut short dune book seri epic an epic need nurtur charact even movi nurtur central charact essenc charact miss
"Omg, where do I even begin. How can you transform a great book with great former adaptations and turn it into a boring AF waste of time.

There is no tension, no convincing acting and the pace will make you fall asleep.

The casting was made with pleasing the crowds in mind and not with the story, Timothy has the magnetism of plastic and the pairing with Zendaya feels forced and boring.

The magical and mystical elements of the book are completely missing or underplayed, as are the political motivations, there is no pending feelings of doom.

Also it feels more like a movie set in ancient Arabia rather than in space. In summary save yourself time and money and watch the 1984 version instead.",omg i even begin how transform great book great former adapt turn bore af wast time there tension convinc act pace make fall asleep the cast made plea crowd mind stori timothi magnet plastic pair zendaya feel forc bore the magic mystic element book complet miss underplay polit motiv pend feel doom also feel like movi set ancient arabia rather space in summari save time money watch version instead
"I just saw the new movie ""Dune: Part Two"" and I was speechless.

It was amazing, full of creativity and an unforgettable action.

From the sensational footage, which I will constantly praise, to the story and everything that the Dune universe means.

Shocking scenes, dramatic scenes, romantic scenes but also full scenes, full of action, carnage and explosions.

Something I've been waiting for so long and it was more perfect than I expected...

In Imax, the sound was so good that at any explosion or need for bass, it creates a shock, an earthquake that gives incredible pleasure.

You must see it and I declare that it is the best film of 2024 and I don't think that any of the upcoming movies will be better.

"Dune 1 and 2 are the greatest works in cinema history, let me explain. Dune is based on Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel, but in this combo, it speaks about politics, the use of religion as a political tool for manipulating the masses, it delves into ecology, and within all that, it intertwines the romance of Paul Atreides and Chani, which challenges politics and the empire. It's a story that demands an extremely complex adaptation for a film that, combining both parts, runs around 340 minutes, but Denis Villeneuve managed to capture the essence of Frank Herbert's literary work and gave us the best sci-fi film in history.",dune greatest work cinema histori let explain dune base frank herbert scifi novel combo speak polit use religion polit tool manipul mass delv ecolog within intertwin romanc paul atreid chani challeng polit empir it stori demand extrem complex adapt film combin part run around minut deni villeneuv manag captur essenc frank herbert literari work gave u best scifi film histori
"The film is incredible.

The acting, score, costume design, special effects. Everything about this film is so very well done.

I'm a big fan of the book and was curious as to how they were going to tackle or introduce some of the things that happen.

I felt like what was delivered in Dune: Part Two was the best adaptation they could have made.

There are changes, for sure. But a book like Dune, written the way it was written (with lots of perspective and inner monologue) was never going to 100% translate to the big screen. It's tricky adapting books at the best of times.

The limited time a film has to tell a story like Dune also would have led to some of the changes in plot and character development.

"What a movie! One of the best I have ever seen! It was all I wanted and more. The visuals, the sound, the acting, the dialogue - they are all at their highest. Absolutely spectacular!

I strongly recommend seeing it in a cinema. The movie is great, but the cinema experience amplifies that grateness.

I know the source material was really good to start with, but the way the director captured the storyline, built the characters and delivered it all to the audience, is simply a masterpiece.

I think the pace of the movie was perfect. Slow at the times we wanted to savor the moments, fast enough through the rest, and constantly intense.

And even though we are introduced to quite a bunch of new characters, they are all given enough time for the audience to understand who they are and what is their role in the story.

"This is a truly amazing movie that showcases Villeneuve's artistry on multiple levels. Many storytelling choices that deviate from the book were actually smart, so a lot of thought definitely went into the script. But somehow the big picture got lost.

What I found very evocative in the first Dune film by Villeneuve was Paul's struggle with his mother's vision for his life. It formed a kind of emotional core in the movie which suited the format perfectly. When you spend 2-3 hours in the cinema, you expect a certain story arc.

This theme is obviously also a major red thread in the books and so continues in Part Two. But all the spectacular imagery, music and ethos does not make up for the rather wooden character development of Paul. Timothée Chamalet is a fantastic actor so you follow the story anyway. The film would have been so much stronger though if his evolution from troubled teen to messianic warlord were just a little more carefully crafted in the script.

This shortcoming is also visible in Paul's relationship with Chani. On many levels their romance is very plausible and compelling. Towards the end of the film, the mystery wrapped around Paul's destiny inevitably comes between them. But there is so much storytelling potential in this emotional timebomb that just seems to fall flat.

Besides these and other minor flaws, there are so many reasons to see this film. Some of my favorite moments are delivered by the actors Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Zendaya (Chani), Stellan Skårsgard (Baron Harkonnen) and the chilling Austin Butler (Feyd-Rautha).",thi truli amaz movi showcas villeneuv artistri multipl level mani storytel choic deviat book actual smart lot thought definit went script but somehow big pictur got lost what i found evoc first dune film villeneuv paul struggl mother vision life it form kind emot core movi suit format perfectli when spend hour cinema expect certain stori arc thi theme obvious also major red thread book continu part two but spectacular imageri music etho make rather wooden charact develop paul timoth chamalet fantast actor follow stori anyway the film would much stronger though evolut troubl teen messian warlord littl care craft script thi shortcom also visibl paul relationship chani on mani level romanc plausibl compel toward end film mysteri wrap around paul destini inevit come but much storytel potenti emot timebomb seem fall flat besid minor flaw mani reason see film some favorit moment deliv actor rebecca ferguson ladi jessica zendaya chani stellan skrsgard baron harkonnen chill austin butler feydrautha

"And we're back! Following the......experiment.....that was 2021's Dune, Denis Villanueve is back with the sequel. Like the first one, this is a perfectly crafted piece of sci fi filmmaking, however UNLIKE the first Dune, Dune 2 is not a total snoozer as things actually happen on screen this time around. The shots, the music, the sound design are all top notch.

I still find myself baffled by these movies. Again, I am the super ultimate target audience for weird sci fi stuff, and I love most of Denis Villanueve's work, even with all of the whiz bang taking place in Dune2, I still found myself yawning at times. I can't keep track of any of the characters names, I have only a basic understanding of who is doing what, I am not mesmerised by Timothee Chalamet nor Zendaya's acting. They both seem kind of wooden to me. Also, by about the 17th or 18th time they push in for a super close up on Zendaya's weird face and linger there for what seemed like hours on end, I began to grow weary.

I don't know, I think I must be the problem. Everyone else in the world seems to love these same movies, so I must be some sort of freak or miscreant.

To me this is an amped up version of the first Dune.

"It's remarkable how much praise this film has received. The novels are complex, political, emotional, and captivating. The first Villaneuve film of 2021 was very slow and sullen but had a certain elegance at times, if one could sit through it (I had to pause every fifteen minutes). In Part Two, however, the plot has been altered in unnecessary and absurd ways, and drama, complexity, and interest have been drained, sacrificed to three hours of CGI and cardboard acting. The good cast sound like they're sight-reading their lines. Villaneuve has been quoted as saying that he doesn't like rehearsing actors. But if one expects a thematically driven story like this to emerge, I'm afraid it's the people, not the effects, that are critical. Timothee' Chalamet's monotone, rhythm-free delivery--his only style, is no help.

It's extremely ironic that David Lynch's 1984 Dune was so roundly panned (and to be fair, it is not good) while this chaotic, gray, interminable yawn-fest has received almost universal accolades; at least the Lynch film had quirkiness and character. Frank Herbert, author of the Dune novels, is reported to have liked the Lynch film. I hardly think he would have approved of this sluggish travesty.",it remark much prais film receiv the novel complex polit emot captiv the first villaneuv film slow sullen certain eleg time one could sit i paus everi fifteen minut in part two howev plot alter unnecessari absurd way drama complex interest drain sacrif three hour cgi cardboard act the good cast sound like theyr sightread line villaneuv quot say doesnt like rehears actor but one expect themat driven stori like emerg im afraid peopl effect critic timothe chalamet monoton rhythmfre deliveryhi style help it extrem iron david lynch dune roundli pan fair good chaotic gray intermin yawnfest receiv almost univers accolad least lynch film quirki charact frank herbert author dune novel report like lynch film i hardli think would approv sluggish travesti

I never think the movie was too long, time passing by, it feels never so long. There are also breathtaking thrilling moments. The effects are marvelous! Costumes fits perfectly!

What can I say else? I'm waiting for a very long time to see a movie like this, in the last month's (maybe year) I watched very less movies, because there is not so much too see, that don't feel like trash. I want more films like this one. Hi to cinema! Watch it!

From the visuals to the sound design, acting, story, this is truly the lord of the rings of this generation. This film focuses on the second half of the book which has all of the big war scenes and this film is honestly adapted a little more loosely from the book compared to the first part which I thought was brilliantly adapted.

"By Ian Chandler - March 11, 2024

Dune: Part Two is a largely remarkable sci-fi spectacle that benefits greatly from the buildup of its fantastic predecessor. Continuing almost directly after the first part, the film reinvites viewers to the atmospheric, entrancing world of Arrakis in the shoes of Paul, now accompanied with the Fremen. Also complementing the film is the score. This soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, enhances the film's overall mood; even so, it is not a particularly memorable one. The cinematography is one of the picture's greatest highlights, providing stunning visuals that are certainly going to be on display for those 8K televisions on sale. The first act is mysterious and tense. The set pieces and plot points are both otherworldly and eerie. It glues one's eyes to the screen, and refuses to let them go.

Character development is a large focus throughout the film and the world of Arrakis is further explored. Timothee Chalamet is talented in the lead role, giving in convincing emotion without going overboard. Zendaya plays the role of Chani, though her portrayal here is similar to another character she played, Michelle Watson. Several other A-list actors light the screen as well. Austin Butler in particular does a phenomenal job as an incredibly frightening villain. Stellan Skarsgård's talent as the Baron also returns, with the same sinister energy found in the preceding film. The remaining actors do a well job at their roles, but are lacking in screen time to give too much of an impression.

With the above-average acting, the appropriate score, and the exceptional cinematography, the first two hours are excellent! The last thirty minutes, unfortunately, are a weak point. The pacing is thrice in speed and unspecified aspects feel lazier than they should. This was also a problem in its 1965 source material, and it is a shame to see no improvement in the movie released nearly sixty years after. It is no dealbreaker; even so, it does hamper the film's overall quality by no small margin.

Dune: Part Two - 74/100 The film is ambitious, atmospheric, and well-acted, but its third act goes at the speed of a bullet train.",by ian chandler march dune part two larg remark scifi spectacl benefit greatli buildup fantast predecessor continu almost directli first part film reinvit viewer atmospher entranc world arraki shoe paul accompani fremen also complement film score thi soundtrack compos han zimmer enhanc film overal mood even particularli memor one the cinematographi one pictur greatest highlight provid stun visual certainli go display k televis sale the first act mysteri ten the set piec plot point otherworldli eeri it glue one eye screen refus let go charact develop larg focu throughout film world arraki explor timothe chalamet talent lead role give convinc emot without go overboard zendaya play role chani though portray similar anoth charact play michel watson sever alist actor light screen well austin butler particular phenomen job incred frighten villain stellan skarsgrd talent baron also return sinist energi found preced film the remain actor well job role lack screen time give much impress with aboveaverag act appropri score except cinematographi first two hour excel the last thirti minut unfortun weak point the pace thrice speed unspecifi aspect feel lazier thi also problem sourc materi shame see improv movi releas nearli sixti year it dealbreak even hamper film overal qualiti small margin dune part two the film ambiti atmospher wellact third act goe speed bullet train

I'm now longing for Dune 3. What a cast, what a scenario, everything was natural and flawless. I rarely write reviews.

I also recommend watching part 1 again before going to the next chapter.

Great adaption of the book. Go and see that movie, please!

Eventually, I went to the Grand Rex / The Infinite, in Paris.

"All the visuals are amazing. It is clear where most of the time and budget went. Score is great.

With that said, character developement and storytelling are stuck in the sand of poor filmmaking. I realize that the book and its genre are a difficult source, but not to that extent. Part of the movie is confusing and the ending - the most important part - is a little ambiguous. The lynch version of dune may have worse effects in it, but as a film it is better.

Also I observe changes in characters from the book for no apparent reason. The love interest at the end seems to be estranged from the protagonist. Why?

Overall I would say this movie is too concerned with the visuals and too little with telling an original story.

I gave it 6 out of 10, because i am a sucker for visuals.",all visual amaz it clear time budget went score great with said charact develop storytel stuck sand poor filmmak i realiz book genr difficult sourc extent part movi confus end import part littl ambigu the lynch version dune may wors effect film better also i observ chang charact book appar reason the love interest end seem estrang protagonist whi overal i would say movi concern visual littl tell origin stori i gave sucker visual

The perfect antidote to those that are tiring of all too similar comic movies. They played it straight the whole time, dramatic, epic, no quips, amazing special effects that never felt excessive. A true blockbuster of a type I hadn't seen in ages.

"Dune: Part Two is a kind of movie that makes some of you people think ''Umm..Another 2H 46M long movie, might feel boring, But after you finished watching it you just wish that it was longer than that.

Yes, I wanted more.

Denis Villeneuve crafted his DUNE world so Beautifully that you can't resist going back. You started watching it and you instantly feel yourself locked up with the screen. The level of Detail in every frame is crazy, stunning. From the religious Fremens to Brutal Harkonnens every single tribe has their own recognition. You can differ them by their gorgeous costumes, their culture, their own living spaces. Dune 1 & 2 is justice to Frank Herberts novel. And all of that was possible because Denis Was selected as the Director. He lead the crew and handled every sector very professionally that the outcome is unbelievably epic.

Thanks to Cinematographer Greig Fraser.

Musician Hans Zimmer and his team.

Production Designer Patrice Vermette.

Costume Designers and the VFX artist.

They bought this out of the world vision of Denis Villeneuve to life.

"Apart from cinematography and set design, the movie is average; only the last half hour is worth it. It's occasionally overly philosophical and slow-paced, reminiscent of Prometheus at times and in atmosphere akin to Blade Runner 2024. Surprisingly, in a world where AI advances rapidly, the special effects here are poorly done. Whether I am too old or if film standards have drastically declined is now a question? Perhaps I expected too much; that sometimes happens with films that carry a certain weight. I would praise Austin Butler, whose acting at times reminds me of a young Christian Bale. ..",apart cinematographi set design movi averag last half hour worth it occasion overli philosoph slowpac reminisc prometheu time atmospher akin blade runner surprisingli world ai advanc rapidli special effect poorli done whether i old film standard drastic declin question perhap i expect much sometim happen film carri certain weight i would prais austin butler whose act time remind young christian bale
"Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a contemporary cinematic masterpiece, echoing the epic scale and impact of the Lord of the Rings trilogy for our generation. Denis Villeneuve's directorial prowess shines through in every frame, orchestrating a visual spectacle that transcends its predecessor. The expansive landscapes of Arrakis, meticulously crafted through a blend of practical effects and CGI, draw audiences into a mesmerizing and authentic world.

The ensemble cast, led by the compelling Timothée Chalamet reprising his role as Paul Atreides, delivers performances that breathe life into the rich characters populating Frank Herbert's universe. Although it's very clear that this movie is Timothée and Zendayas show.

Hans Zimmer's musical composition elevates the film to new heights. His score, a symphony of haunting melodies and tribal beats, seamlessly integrates with the narrative, intensifying the emotional resonance of pivotal moments. Zimmer's contribution becomes an integral part of the Dune experience, leaving a lasting impression.

In exceeding expectations, ""Dune: Part Two"" solidifies its place as a cinematic tour de force. It sets a new standard for the sci-fi genre, offering a timeless and unforgettable experience. Denis Villeneuve's vision, coupled with impeccable visuals, a stellar cast, and a haunting musical score, ensures that ""Dune: Part Two"" will be celebrated as a monumental achievement in filmmaking, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape of our era.",dune part two emerg contemporari cinemat masterpiec echo epic scale impact lord ring trilog gener deni villeneuv directori prowess shine everi frame orchestr visual spectacl transcend predecessor the expans landscap arraki meticul craft blend practic effect cgi draw audienc mesmer authent world the ensembl cast led compel timoth chalamet repris role paul atreid deliv perform breath life rich charact popul frank herbert univers although clear movi timoth zendaya show han zimmer music composit elev film new height hi score symphoni haunt melodi tribal beat seamlessli integr narr intensifi emot reson pivot moment zimmer contribut becom integr part dune experi leav last impress in exceed expect dune part two solidifi place cinemat tour de forc it set new standard scifi genr offer timeless unforgett experi deni villeneuv vision coupl impecc visual stellar cast haunt music score ensur dune part two celebr monument achiev filmmak leav indel mark cinemat landscap era

"Caught the sneak preview last night of Dune 2. How do you put in words the magnificence of a film? There's been many through time but this one just set the bar I believe. First off you've got to see it on IMax. I don't know if the smaller screen would have the same feeling. The effects are seamless. There's nothing else to say about that. And the story is complete from start to finish. But the thing that really sets it apart is the music and sound design holding hands with the effects and cinematography. It's powerful. There were moments when I found myself mesmerized by the effects and sound and lost track of the story a bit, but the phenomenal performances by Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler brought me right back and were quite impressive.

"No spoilers.

But let me be clear my husband is the huge fan of dune, and the series of books. I've seen the Lynches OG. And I like Lynch but it didn't match up to the remake imo.

So now I'll admit I'm not a fan of this genre, and while I did like the first, my husband loved it so I pre booked tickets to this one for a first viewing. I wasn't anywhere near as excited as him.

But my god! I didn't want to look away, it's long at just under 3 hours but it didn't feel it. Not a single scene was needless or ""filler"". The sound was unbelievable the room shook as did the screen visibly at points! Brilliant.

"Dune: Part 2 is a remarkable technical achievement that blends the line between arthouse cinema and a commercial blockbuster and continues to raise the standard for sci-fi epic cinema.

Director Denis Villeneuve ups the spectacle factor, delivering large-scale desert action sequences against a romping Hans Zimmer score. Greg Frasier's breathtaking cinematography continues to reach new heights.

It takes tremendous artistry and effort to find depth and shadow in a perpetually flat and bland desert. I tried to photograph a desert on holiday recently. It's bloody difficult.

The spice, presented as fine sparkling orange grain sprinkled in sand, is sumptuous and addictive to look at. The sandworm riding sequence in IMAX is spectacular. Period

As Paul Atriedes, Timothy Chalamet convincingly transitions from a boy into a full-fledged leader with a hard edge and grit. The central theme of being a messiah for the support of the masses for personal gain without true faith in the cause is richly fascinating.

And yet, Dune: Part Two is a less engaging experience.

Part Two uses the pacing of a commercial blockbuster to cover a bigger chunk of its ambitious story. Having rewatched the first Dune an hour before seeing the second, the pacing was jarring.

What's gone is the lingering mood from the first Dune, where the shots were held a bit too long and slowly immersed the audience into its world. There was a metaphysical quality to Paul's contradictory visions that was compelling. The mood was delivering all the emotions.

Now, these wistful moments are shortened and traded for plot points. It is delivered like summarized information.

I'm aware I'm in the minority and the stylistic transition worked for most people, which is great. I just left the theater exhausted-undesirably I might add.

Perhaps it's the nature of the source material itself. Frank Herbert's book is embedded with lots of scattered themes. The challenge of adapting it theatrically will always be choosing parts of it and condensing it into something cohesive.

The first Dune captured my imagination more deeply. It was like slowly walking into a world with culture, history and intimate access into the characters' inner thoughts. Part Two retained some of those qualities, no doubt, but now's there's an usher hurrying me along to keep the line moving.",dune part remark technic achiev blend line arthous cinema commerci blockbust continu rais standard scifi epic cinema director deni villeneuv up spectacl factor deliv largescal desert action sequenc romp han zimmer score greg frasier breathtak cinematographi continu reach new height it take tremend artistri effort find depth shadow perpetu flat bland desert i tri photograph desert holiday recent it bloodi difficult the spice present fine sparkl orang grain sprinkl sand sumptuou addict look the sandworm ride sequenc imax spectacular period a paul atried timothi chalamet convincingli transit boy fullfledg leader hard edg grit the central theme messiah support mass person gain without true faith caus richli fascin and yet dune part two less engag experi part two use pace commerci blockbust cover bigger chunk ambiti stori have rewatch first dune hour see second pace jar what gone linger mood first dune shot held bit long slowli immers audienc world there metaphys qualiti paul contradictori vision compel the mood deliv emot now wist moment shorten trade plot point it deliv like summar inform im awar im minor stylist transit work peopl great i left theater exhaustedundesir i might add perhap natur sourc materi frank herbert book embed lot scatter theme the challeng adapt theatric alway choos part condens someth cohes the first dune captur imagin deepli it like slowli walk world cultur histori intim access charact inner thought part two retain qualiti doubt now there usher hurri along keep line move

"On the visual and audio side of things, this is a tour de force. Watched in IMAX and this move must have used the subwoofers more than all other movies combined. Your seat is shaking from battles and worms, it's almost too much to take at times.

And visually it's a masterpiece, both in fidelity and in the set and costume design. Not a single feeling of green screen CGI bonanza.

But story and character wise, while not bad, it's just not that engaging. You are never surprised (a problem with sticking close to the well known story). There's a little character development but i would have wanted to see Paul's change with more gradual tension. And the second half seems very rushed, with a lot of big events just thrown in without a lot of reason. Suddenly if feels like Avengers and every fremen is a superhero.

"McDUNE (Diet Edition) Episode: ""The Hollywood Dollar Empire strikes back on creativity, originality, and intelligence, playing it heavy on the safe again and not even trying anything, lest, God forbid, you hesitate and go elsewhere."" ... Did the bold, peculiar, imaginative and complex Dune deserve to become this? Dune has always been out of the mainstream simply because it was weird and that was its grit. But not anymore. Dune became cool, correct and relatable, got a new logo and a silver foil, everything complex and controversial cut out, everything weird toned down, everything surreal turned into realistic, everything absurd into ordinary, and the whole thing has been averaged and run through an AI market analyzer so that today's average, squeamish viewer can enjoy it effortlessly and still manage, in a good mood and unburdened by thoughts, to stop at H&M and New Yorker. Star Trek and Star Wars have been milked to the scabs and the masses need a new franchise... I get it when a Marvel comic receives this treatment, but Dune?... And for the over-cautious, collectivist and standardized Hollywood to embark on such an unscrupulous, unapologetically non-correct and alternative subject on the triumph of individualism is like the DPRK deciding to make Orwell's 1984... And people aren't even ashamed to claim Dune as their childhood idol and do this to it and profit from it with no scruples... And speaking of 1984 (hint: Lynch's Dune), when you consider that they had three times as much space here, do you feel like they delivered three times as much? Not a chance. And when you consider what options we should have in 2024 and what we actually got in the end, it almost makes me cry.... Mind you, this is Dune's fourth (attempted) screen iteration, and you can literally observe how each version became simpler and dumber until it finally clicked with the masses. And if this is the first Dune you've liked, you better get over the fact that you actually like mainstream Hollywood and not Dune. Because Dune is and always has been weird - it was made in the sixties. And if ever Dune should have been mainstream then in the unhinged, trippy and revolutionary 60s. Not in the 2020's dominated by conformism and consumerism... So how do you make it now? A mid-budget animated series that would relieve creators of market pressures and allow them to go deeper, that would have dabbled in the psychedelia and eccentricity that makes Dune Dune, and that would have paid homage to Lynch, Jodorowsky, Moebius, Giger, Foss and the entire 60s - that's what Dune deserved, not another boilerplate and self-absorbed blockbuster, of which there are 12 a dozen every year, and which of all the adaptations of Dune have brought nothing to the table except dollars.",mcdune diet edit episod the hollywood dollar empir strike back creativ origin intellig play heavi safe even tri anyth lest god forbid hesit go elsewher did bold peculiar imagin complex dune deserv becom dune alway mainstream simpli weird grit but anymor dune becam cool correct relat got new logo silver foil everyth complex controversi cut everyth weird tone everyth surreal turn realist everyth absurd ordinari whole thing averag run ai market analyz today averag squeamish viewer enjoy effortlessli still manag good mood unburden thought stop hm new yorker star trek star war milk scab mass need new franchis i get marvel comic receiv treatment dune and overcauti collectivist standard hollywood embark unscrupul unapologet noncorrect altern subject triumph individu like dprk decid make orwel and peopl arent even asham claim dune childhood idol profit scrupl and speak hint lynch dune consid three time much space feel like deliv three time much not chanc and consid option actual got end almost make cri mind dune fourth attempt screen iter liter observ version becam simpler dumber final click mass and first dune youv like better get fact actual like mainstream hollywood dune becaus dune alway weird made sixti and ever dune mainstream unhing trippi revolutionari not domin conform consumer so make a midbudget anim seri would reliev creator market pressur allow go deeper would dabbl psychedelia eccentr make dune dune would paid homag lynch jodorowski moebiu giger foss entir that dune deserv anoth boilerpl selfabsorb blockbust dozen everi year adapt dune brought noth tabl except dollar
"I was blessed to watch the early fan premier of the movie and was left nearly speechless. Every scene is crafted with care and love from the director, crew and actors. The story choices made by Villeneuve work to perfection. Every actor took a step up in their performances from Dune 1. The only reaction i could muster walking out of the theater was that Dune 1 now feels like a movie that was held back and filtered because Dune 2 is everything to 110 percent. But above all, the movie-viewing experience in a big theater is on par with the most epic and satisfying films of all time. Even if a viewer doesn't care about the story, this movie is a true spectacle on the big screen.",i bless watch earli fan premier movi left nearli speechless everi scene craft care love director crew actor the stori choic made villeneuv work perfect everi actor took step perform dune the reaction could muster walk theater dune feel like movi held back filter dune everyth percent but movieview experi big theater par epic satisfi film time even viewer doesnt care stori movi true spectacl big screen
"This is a return to big cinema that passionately screams the heightened possibilities of big-scale filmmaking. Dune: Part Two is a masterful film in its ability to capture the imagination. While sci-fi, the only ""aliens"" you will encounter are the inhumane humans you are forced to accept as humans. An all-time character study of the human race and its faults. There is a power here that tasks the audience with quiet-car-ride introspective questions.

How does religious fanaticism corrupt mankind, and how is this human condition controlled?

What does ""revenge"" mean, and how far should one pursue it? To what end?

When do hopeful beliefs turn into blind faith? And does this inspire goodness, evil, or something else entirely?

With this film, Denis Villeneuve easily places him into the coveted conversation of the greatest sci-fi directors of all time. Here, he crafts a world that oozes mythology and philosophy, sprinkled with excellent action set-pieces.

Extremely timely, but timeless in its commentary of who man is. Not only a visual feast to enjoy, but something that will leave you challenged: something rarely experienced nowadays.",thi return big cinema passion scream heighten possibl bigscal filmmak dune part two master film abil captur imagin while scifi alien encount inhuman human forc accept human an alltim charact studi human race fault there power task audienc quietcarrid introspect question how religi fanatic corrupt mankind human condit control what reveng mean far one pursu to end when hope belief turn blind faith and inspir good evil someth el entir with film deni villeneuv easili place covet convers greatest scifi director time here craft world ooz mytholog philosophi sprinkl excel action setpiec extrem time timeless commentari man not visual feast enjoy someth leav challeng someth rare experienc nowaday
"The film picks up seamlessly from where the first part left off, with Paul Atreides embracing his destiny as the messianic figure known as Muad'Dib. As Paul navigates Arrakis, he faces new challenges and discovers himself together with the enigmatic Fremen warrior Chani, whose relationship with Paul deepens amidst the turmoil of revolution.

Visually stunning and meticulously crafted, transporrted me to the desolate yet enchanting world of Arrakis,The cinematography captures the grandeur of the desert planet while also highlighting its harsh beauty.

In addition to its visual and narrative prowess, ""Dune: Part Two"" also explores themes of power, religion, and identity with thought-provoking depth. As Paul grapples with his newfound status as a religious figurehead and the weight of his own destiny, the movie raised compelling questions about the nature of leadership and the consequences of such power.

Overall, this was a masterful continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation, delivering spectacle, substance, and emotional resonance in equal measure. With stunning visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it was and always will be, a must watch for me.",the film pick seamlessli first part left paul atreid embrac destini messian figur known muaddib a paul navig arraki face new challeng discov togeth enigmat fremen warrior chani whose relationship paul deepen amidst turmoil revolut visual stun meticul craft transporrt desol yet enchant world arrakisth cinematographi captur grandeur desert planet also highlight harsh beauti in addit visual narr prowess dune part two also explor theme power religion ident thoughtprovok depth a paul grappl newfound statu religi figurehead weight destini movi rais compel question natur leadership consequ power overal master continu deni villeneuv ambiti adapt deliv spectacl substanc emot reson equal measur with stun visual compel perform rich themat depth alway must watch
"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part 2"" is nothing short of a magnificent triumph in the world of cinema. As a sequel to the already amazing first installment, Villeneuve once again proves his directorial prowess, delivering a film that surpasses its predecessor in every aspect.

First and foremost, a grand applause must be given to Villeneuve for his masterful direction. Not a moment in the film feels slow or out of place. Every scene is meticulously crafted, drawing the audience deeper into the rich and expansive universe of Dune. Villeneuve's attention to detail is evident in every frame, making this a true cinematic experience that demands to be seen on the biggest of screens.

Hans Zimmer's exceptional soundtrack deserves special mention, as it adds another layer of depth and emotion to the film. Zimmer's ability to craft soundscapes that evoke feelings and enhance the narrative is unparalleled, and in ""Dune: Part 2,"" he once again showcases his talent with top-notch compositions that resonate throughout the entire movie.

The cast delivers standout performances, with each actor bringing their character to life in a way that feels authentic and captivating. From the stoic Paul Atreides portrayed by Timothée Chalamet to the fierce Lady Jessica played by Rebecca Ferguson, the ensemble cast shines in their respective roles.

One cannot overlook the breathtaking cinematography that transports viewers to the vast and mystical world of Arrakis. Every shot is a work of art, capturing the sweeping landscapes and intricate details of the Dune universe.

Watching ""Dune: Part 2"" is more than just a movie-watching experience; it's a journey. The feelings evoked during the film, the sense of wonder and awe, linger long after the credits roll. It's akin to going on a retreat to an island of pure relaxation, where every moment is filled with a sense of freedom and immersion in a world unlike any other.

As the credits rolled, the anticipation for the third installment is palpable. The wait may be painful, but the promise of ""Dune: The Prophecy"" as a TV series is something to look forward to.

"Last 20 Mins is just pure goosebumps 🔥🔥 Denis Villeneuve proves that he is a next genius mind director after James Cameron.

Totally speechless no words to say there's a lot of stories going around in the film but the way director has managed the characters and the timings that they are in specially the political situation and then there's the magic realm all at once is not an easy job but Denis Villeneuve has done it and the film is remarkable.

Dune 1 ending has made a lot of suspecious about the half ending of the film specially it was also criticised by the people by not the proper ending but DUNE 2 will make everyone quiet. Because the ending of the film is perfectly well balanced and it's gives a hope of the next and the last one to come.

Story, screenplay, cinematography and other aspects top of the world specially the CGI of Dune franchise is something else to witness that I've never witness before. Totally different from other films.

Costumes & Visual presentation is outstanding no complaints there at all.

Performance are the also one of the big surprise of the film specially TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, ZENDAYA, REBECCA FERGUSON & AUSTIN BUTLER a phenomenal performance by all of them with rest of the cast doesn't disappoint too.

Dune 2 will definitely give an experience that you haven't witness specially in battle scenes the tensions that director build is just brilliant. There should be more battle scenes or those were there in the film weren't as long as the 1st part but still it's justifies the film because the story has so much to tell as you'll easily get invested into that.

Overall A Complete Visual Masterpiece just like the 1st one but with more story perfection and complexities you're gonna witness in this one.

A worth watch and give a IMAX experience because the visuals will just store your interest very well.

"This is a beautifully made, mostly entertaining film.

It does feel that so many movies are now being made to be watched in the cinema - all sound and vision, beautiful cinematography, artistic set pieces, lots of weird booming noises, visual metaphors and if you're lucky great music.

Dune 2 is no exception, a rollercoaster ride of a film, a popcorn flix.

Unfortunately this all means that the story suffers, becoming either bland and predictable or mysterious without making any real sense.

Frank Herbert's Dune creates a complex 'galaxy' with important story elements (the significance of spice in holding the planets/ empire together, the crucial role of the spacing guild that Paul uses to defeat all of his enemies) but this film seems barely aware of them. So much so that it seems they cannot make a sequel worth making. David Lynch's attempt is like a masterpiece in comparison.

Having said that, I enjoyed it far more than the first one and I did enjoy watching almost all of it. Great acting and special effects.

A really great film to watch at the cinema.

"This is without doubt an impressive visual spectacle. However the story line is so thin it's almost transparent. Given the two films add up to almost five hours if you have read the books or seen the TV mini series it won't make much sense in the way the story should be told. There is no rational why Spice is so valuable or how the Bene Gesserit are involved in the whole scheme of thIngs and these are two of the three core tenets of the whole saga. This rendition omits any explanation of the Emperor, Spacing Guild or of Paul's sister Alia.

It's sad that the story in these films is so diluted that the spectacles have no attachment.",thi without doubt impress visual spectacl howev stori line thin almost transpar given two film add almost five hour read book seen tv mini seri wont make much sen way stori told there ration spice valuabl bene gesserit involv whole scheme thing two three core tenet whole saga thi rendit omit explan emperor space guild paul sister alia it sad stori film dilut spectacl attach
"Dune 2 is perfect as the sequel. It is equally engaging, stylish, serene and deliverer of exqusiteness in narratives. A twisting climax and well made plot, perhaps will go for part 3, only will then make sense of the entire story from part 1. Waiting for part 3 which I feel will be optimistic in whole. But don't miss its prequel, it's a recommendation.

The acting is good, with all performers giving their best that creates unique characterization in sci-fi set up. The technicals are top notch, Hans Zimmer especially. His work in sci-fi is unquestionably perfect, just above the world. Dennis Villeneuve too is one of the best upcoming director of Science Fiction genre. His works appeals to what sci-fi really stands for, the narratives and presentations are always appealing. An expected liberator from injustices in the exoplanet having sand as the elixir of life mixing with political issues, true love and and the bit- pieces of religious propaganda forms the storyline. The climax is not expected though but will make you think about the film. The special effects, the CGI, the action scenes are all amazing to watch. The introduction of the new antagony is good though, a kinda fearsome and truly evil.

Dennis Villeneuve's Dune is a franchise from Sci-fi genre that would rank similar to The Dark knight franchise in action genre and Lord of rings franchise from Fantasy genre. Summing up it's a brilliant film with stunning visuals, good storyline and impressive actions plus narrations. The book lovers must give it a definite watch.

"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part Two"" arrives, fulfilling the promise of its predecessor with stunning visuals, epic action sequences, and a deeper dive into Frank Herbert's captivating universe.

The film is a feast for the eyes. From the vast, shimmering deserts of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, every frame is meticulously crafted and awe-inspiring. Building on the foundation laid in Part One, the action is bigger, bolder, and more thrilling. The sandworm battles are particularly impressive, showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures. While the first half focuses heavily on world-building, the sequel delves deeper into character development. We see Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) grapple with his destiny, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the Fremen power dynamics, and Chani (Zendaya) emerge as a strong voice of reason. The cast delivers strong performances across the board. Chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted Paul, while Ferguson brings depth and complexity to Lady Jessica. Zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of Chani, and the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, adds further weight to the narrative.

The film's first half feels rushed at times, cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in Part One. This can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material. While visually stunning, the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment. The complex themes of power, destiny, and ecological balance are present, but not fully explored. The film ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for a potential third part. While this may leave some viewers satisfied, others might find it frustrating.

The cinematography by Greig Fraser is magnificent, capturing the vastness of Arrakis and the intricate details of the Fremen culture. The score by Hans Zimmer is once again powerful and evocative, adding to the film's epic atmosphere. The sound design is immersive, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.

""Dune: Part Two"" is a visually stunning and action-packed continuation of the epic saga. While the pacing and emotional impact are not quite as strong as the first film, the performances, technical aspects, and deeper exploration of the characters and world make it a worthwhile experience for fans of science fiction and grand-scale storytelling. However, be prepared for a conclusion that leaves you wanting more.",deni villeneuv dune part two arriv fulfil promis predecessor stun visual epic action sequenc deeper dive frank herbert captiv univers the film feast eye from vast shimmer desert arraki intric design fremen cultur everi frame meticul craft aweinspir build foundat laid part one action bigger bolder thrill the sandworm battl particularli impress showcas immens power scale creatur while first half focus heavili worldbuild sequel delv deeper charact develop we see paul atreid timoth chalamet grappl destini ladi jessica rebecca ferguson navig fremen power dynam chani zendaya emerg strong voic reason the cast deliv strong perform across board chalamet continu impress conflict paul ferguson bring depth complex ladi jessica zendaya shine nuanc portray chani support cast includ javier bardem josh brolin add weight narr the film first half feel rush time cram lot exposit catch viewer plot point left unresolv part one thi jar unfamiliar sourc materi while visual stun film struggl match emot weight first instal the complex theme power destini ecolog balanc present fulli explor the film end cliffhang set stage potenti third part while may leav viewer satisfi other might find frustrat the cinematographi greig fraser magnific captur vast arraki intric detail fremen cultur the score han zimmer power evoc ad film epic atmospher the sound design immers place viewer right heart action dune part two visual stun actionpack continu epic saga while pace emot impact quit strong first film perform technic aspect deeper explor charact world make worthwhil experi fan scienc fiction grandscal storytel howev prepar conclus leav want

"Born late to witness Empire Strikes back, too young to understand the hype around return of the king but on time for DUNE part 2.

Dune part 2 is a peak cinematic experience specially in IMAX, From the word go you are stuck into the sand of Arrakis and a faith that messiah will save fremen from the violence of emperor.

Every Sci-Fi movie audience is prepared for the huge visual scenes, battles, action sequence but it happens rarely that dialogues are given this much importance. And that' where Dune part 2 prevails. Dune shows the importance of proper writing, tight screenplay and visuals done right.

Cinematography specially in third act of the movie shows the scale of Greig fraser and that scale is unimaginable. Crisp editing, brilliant score by the Hans Zimmer are cherry on the top.

Rebecca Furguson and Zendaya have given a performance of life time. Javier Burdem's performance as Stalgir seems to be funny in first phase of the movie, A faithful servant of the holy folks told about the messiah but as the movie goes by it slowly converts into the horror and that where Javier Bordem and josh brolin's Act seems legit and strong.

Austin butler is madness, he shown his peak in those entry sequences.

There are no words that are enough to explain the Timothee chalamat as messiah of fremen. Timothee as Paul Atredis is the best casting that has took place. That shift from a hopeful prince to fearful leader of cult is Amazing.

"I was very much looking forward to this movie, since I enjoyed part one. Also because Dennis Villeneuve sets a high standard for himself, I started watching with high expectations, but this movie is not the master piece some claim it to be.

Others here have written similar remarks: there is somehow a lack of depth to this movie. The story and the characters are rather shallow, despite the build-up from part one, which seemed to have much more depth. The movie is even rather boring at times.

The strong point of the film is that it is visually stunning, although nothing revolutionary. What also struck me is that soundeffect-wise this movie is very similar to other Hollywood blockbusters, which is a let down. I expected more, since the first movie had some very original sound effects.

Don't get me wrong, it's not at all a bad movie, it's entertaining at times. But it is definitely not a classic like 'the empire strikes back', as some people claim.",i much look forward movi sinc i enjoy part one also denni villeneuv set high standard i start watch high expect movi master piec claim other written similar remark somehow lack depth movi the stori charact rather shallow despit buildup part one seem much depth the movi even rather bore time the strong point film visual stun although noth revolutionari what also struck soundeffectwis movi similar hollywood blockbust let i expect sinc first movi origin sound effect dont get wrong bad movi entertain time but definit classic like empir strike back peopl claim
"This was an utterly fabulous cinematic and spiritual experience. I was drawn into Villeneuve's world by the enormous scale of the design, the undeniable pull of a religious fable, the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual design.

It's strange how often critics (pro or amateur) think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story; that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do (cameos are derided); that the politics of casting must be taken into account; that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevant.

Cinema IS moving pictures, and whilst sound is not a requirement, even ""silent"" era classics made good use of music and effects. Story is important, but cinema's unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way. Story alone cannot do this.

Admittedly, one's hearing does feel at risk at times, but without the awesome sound design, Dune: Part Two would be diminished. I was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movie's visceral delivery. This was not some sentimental response to the tale, but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power, corruption, revenge, faith, identity - the spiritual battle of Good and Evil. These were, for me, of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two Houses and the Emperor., which is, in any case, subordinate to the power wielded by the Benegesserit which the Reverend Mothers themselves recognise is not supreme.

However, if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a post-imperial world, they are still very visible, and the ""romance"" between Paul and Chani is not a romance at all, burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a Messianic future.

I should add that I am neither a fan of the books, having read barely 100 pages of the first, nor, as an atheist, do I adhere to any religious faith. I am, however, a believer in the power of cinema.",thi utterli fabul cinemat spiritu experi i drawn villeneuv world enorm scale design undeni pull religi fabl convict lead player power sound visual design it strang often critic pro amateur think sound visual somehow mere adjunct stori celebr actor must someth worthi cameo derid polit cast must taken account old stori must modern take make relev cinema is move pictur whilst sound requir even silent era classic made good use music effect stori import cinema uniqu power capac move audienc engag two sen primev way stori alon cannot admittedli one hear feel risk time without awesom sound design dune part two would diminish i emot overwhelm power movi viscer deliveri thi sentiment respons tale gut reaction physic transmiss theme power corrupt reveng faith ident spiritu battl good evil these greater signific mere polit struggl two hous emperor case subordin power wield benegesserit reverend mother recognis suprem howev want see parallel contemporari issu problem live postimperi world still visibl romanc paul chani romanc burden vision portent messian futur i add i neither fan book read bare page first atheist i adher religi faith i howev believ power cinema
"Dune 1 felt a lot like an intro. Beautiful made and created, with a great soundtrack to support that ""mood"". But, without any changes of pace to support that build-up of epicness and suspense into something memorable and climactic.

The abstraction and dialogues also prevented me from really being immersed in the movie. I kept in the role of a distant observer, watching some piece of art. Quite relaxing, but not very exhilarating. Something I do expect from an epic telling of Dune.

And I can't say that changed much in part 2. Yes, the story continues and becomes a bit more interesting, because we start to move more towards the climax of the story. But the style is still the same. I don't get immersed, I'm just an observer. Again a beautiful and a sort of peaceful experience, where even the battle scenes pass by in an muted dream state.

It was only up to +- a half hour before the end there was finally some emotion coming out with a bit more pace. That's also when I knew, he does this not enough. It needs to dance more with different pacings to really make It memorable.

So I appreciate the artfulness of the movies. He's created a beautiful and interesting world, but everything inside of It, the people, the life, the story feels muted and dead, like a painting.",dune felt lot like intro beauti made creat great soundtrack support mood but without chang pace support buildup epic suspens someth memor climact the abstract dialogu also prevent realli immers movi i kept role distant observ watch piec art quit relax exhilar someth i expect epic tell dune and i cant say chang much part ye stori continu becom bit interest start move toward climax stori but style still i dont get immers im observ again beauti sort peac experi even battl scene pas mute dream state it half hour end final emot come bit pace that also i knew enough it need danc differ pace realli make it memor so i appreci art movi he creat beauti interest world everyth insid it peopl life stori feel mute dead like paint
"An 8.5 on IMDb for Dune: Part Two? That's absolutely ridiculous. Yes, the CGI is stunning, and the visuals are undeniably impressive, but great effects alone don't make a great movie. The story feels cold, distant, and completely detached, offering no emotional engagement or connection to the audience. It's so focused on being grand and visually striking that it forgets to tell a compelling story or make you care about what's happening. The characters feel underdeveloped.

And the acting? Mediocre at best. There's not a single performance that truly stands out.

It's frustrating to see a movie get this much praise when it clearly doesn't deliver where it actually matters.",an imdb dune part two that absolut ridicul ye cgi stun visual undeni impress great effect alon dont make great movi the stori feel cold distant complet detach offer emot engag connect audienc it focus grand visual strike forget tell compel stori make care what happen the charact feel underdevelop and act mediocr best there singl perform truli stand it frustrat see movi get much prais clearli doesnt deliv actual matter
"I felt like I was watching cinematic history play out before my eyes. Absolute masterpiece. I can't name a single movie that has shaken me this deeply.

I felt like I wanted to be a part of the world - even more than I did when I first watched Avatar in the theater. And, if we're going to compare the two, the visuals and cultural depth in this movie are better. The plot development is leagues ahead, as is the acting.

The Christian parallels, in particular, struck me profoundly. As a Christian myself, there were a few scenes when I actually cried. Not for sadness - for sheer awe. Especially when Paul truly assumes his full power. Tingles everywhere.

Wow. I'm not even coherent right now.

"What a stunning piece of cinema. If you could create a new genre named 'sophisticated Sci-Fi' then this would be top of the rankings.

After Dune Part One, I was hopeful, expectant but a little apprehensive as to what was coming next. Despite the incredible cinematography, the first film was quite slow going and convoluted in setting up the premise. However, I needn't have worried as part two was a much simpler premise setting up the Paul Atreides' revenge story, but also gave so much action, drama and moment of pure tension. Austin Butler's psychotic portrayal of Feyd-Rautha stole the show but there were also excellent turns from Chalamet, Zendaya and the who's who of Hollywood.

What is clear is that Villeneuve does scale better than any of his peers, and when the worms take front and centre in some of the biggest scenes, he shows why he is a master of his art. It really is a film that deserves to be on the big screen and showed once more why we should savour our cinemas before it's too late.",what stun piec cinema if could creat new genr name sophist scifi would top rank after dune part one i hope expect littl apprehens come next despit incred cinematographi first film quit slow go convolut set premis howev i neednt worri part two much simpler premis set paul atreid reveng stori also gave much action drama moment pure tension austin butler psychot portray feydrautha stole show also excel turn chalamet zendaya who hollywood what clear villeneuv scale better peer worm take front centr biggest scene show master art it realli film deserv big screen show savour cinema late

I was so disappointed with myself for not seeing Part One in the theatres, but I promised myself that I wouldn't deny myself of this wonderful experience.

"Incredibly grateful to have seen this as it was released! Feels like I got to see Star Wars or Lord of the Rings on opening night!! Absolutely stunning!

I read the books and fell in love! After the first movie I was so happy that Denis Villeneuve did the book justice and prayed that the second would live up to it. It exceeded it by far. I genuinely have no complaints. Despite knowing what was going to happen from reading the books I was on the edge of my seat still questioning the outcome of fight scenes.

The casting was spot on, the music was incredible, the visuals were insane, and the cinematography was legendary.

"The production values and visual effects are stunning but the fragmented storytelling and ludicrous battle scenes snuffle out any emotional excitement. In contrast to the first part the characters stay pretty one-dimensional. The script and dialog doesn't provide much substance for skilful acting leaving the viewer somewhat deprived of any engagement with the protagonists. So the entertainment purely comes from the visual grandeur. The sweeping desert landscapes with its beautiful colours contrasting with the black and white world of the Harkonnen is nothing short of breathtaking. And watching the Fremen surfing the desert on gigantic sandworms is worth the time spent, even only just.",the product valu visual effect stun fragment storytel ludicr battl scene snuffl emot excit in contrast first part charact stay pretti onedimension the script dialog doesnt provid much substanc skil act leav viewer somewhat depriv engag protagonist so entertain pure come visual grandeur the sweep desert landscap beauti colour contrast black white world harkonnen noth short breathtak and watch fremen surf desert gigant sandworm worth time spent even

But the characters aren't having any fun, and they aren't fun to watch. All of my favorite sci-fi movies have likable characters. Star Wars had Han and Luke and Leigh with a side of Chewy. Terminator 2 had Arnold, and Linda Hamilton. Alien had Sigourney. This movie just leaves you with an overall sense of dread. It's not fun.

"Dune 2 is a masterful continuation of the epic saga set in a captivating sci-fi universe. Building upon the rich lore established in its predecessor, this film immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue, fantastical landscapes, and profound character development.

Director Denis Villeneuve's visionary approach brings Frank Herbert's iconic novel to life with unparalleled brilliance. From the sweeping desert vistas to the intricate details of the various factions, every frame is a testament to meticulous craftsmanship.

The performances are nothing short of stellar, with each actor fully embodying their respective roles. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides exudes both vulnerability and strength, anchoring the narrative with a compelling presence. Supporting cast members, including Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Ferguson, deliver equally captivating performances, adding depth to the ensemble.

The visual effects are breathtaking, seamlessly blending practical and CGI elements to create a visually stunning world that feels both authentic and otherworldly. Hans Zimmer's haunting score further elevates the cinematic experience, imbuing each scene with an emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits roll.

What truly sets *Dune 2* apart, however, is its thematic depth. Beneath the spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, destiny, and the human condition. As the story unfolds, it poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of leadership, the consequences of choice, and the interconnectedness of all life.

In conclusion, Dune 2 is a triumph on every level. It surpasses its predecessor in scope, ambition, and execution, delivering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. A true masterpiece of modern cinema, deserving of the highest praise.",dune master continu epic saga set captiv scifi univers build upon rich lore establish predecessor film immers viewer world polit intrigu fantast landscap profound charact develop director deni villeneuv visionari approach bring frank herbert icon novel life unparallel brillianc from sweep desert vista intric detail variou faction everi frame testament meticul craftsmanship the perform noth short stellar actor fulli embodi respect role timoth chalamet portray paul atreid exud vulner strength anchor narr compel presenc support cast member includ zendaya oscar isaac rebecca ferguson deliv equal captiv perform ad depth ensembl the visual effect breathtak seamlessli blend practic cgi element creat visual stun world feel authent otherworldli han zimmer haunt score elev cinemat experi imbu scene emot reson linger long credit roll what truli set dune apart howev themat depth beneath spectacl lie poignant explor power destini human condit a stori unfold pose thoughtprovok question natur leadership consequ choic interconnected life in conclus dune triumph everi level it surpass predecessor scope ambit execut deliv film intellectu stimul visual captiv a true masterpiec modern cinema deserv highest prais
"I'd already loved seeing the first part in IMAX, but with this second opus, Villeneuve has completely amazed me. The film is even more grandiose than the first, with actors, music, and visuals that are as powerful as ever, memorable and thrilling for over 2.5 hours.

Blending religion, politics and romance, Villeneuve's script takes just the right amount of time between action scenes to convey the complexity of Frank Herbert's universe. I left the cinema breathless, having not seen such a complete science fiction film for a very long time.

Go to the cinema as soon as you can, because the experience is unique.

On top of that, one of the VFX supervisors, Gerd Nefzer was there as a special guest. It was an experience I will never forget. The whole theater was shaking during action scenes with intense sound. And of course the movie itself is a masterpiece. It's also significantly better than the first movie.

"First, a few words on the IMAX presentation I saw in Geneva, Switzerland (Balexert cinémas). Certainly spectacular, but the Dolby Atmos presentation is pretty earth shattering -- and ear shattering -- in the action sequences. Wear concert earplugs or be prepared to cover your ears for part of the film since permanent hearing damage is a risk if volume levels are like those in the presentation I saw.

As for the film. Bottom line. The day after watching Dune Part Two, I wanted to watch it again. I recently re-watched Dune Part One on my home system (55 inch OLED TV and Dolby Atmos soundbar). I picked up significant character and plot detail that I'd missed on my initial viewing. I expect I will have the same experience with Dune Part Two. There is a lot in this film -- but even at 2 hours, 45 minutes a few things that were missing.

The visuals are amazing. No CGI artifacts I could see -- in contrast to an IMAX 'Kong v. Godzilla' trailer that ran just before the film. Incredible world-building, as in Part One. Everything appears very natural, even when the settings are strange, other-worldly.

This is a film without a dull moment. Every scene is critical to the story's forward movement. That movement is relentless. For me, that was a problem. Not everything was explained to my satisfaction. These weren't exactly plot holes, but rather plot ellipses.

I hope Villeneuve produces a longer -- at least 3h -- director's cut that gives the film a bit more room to breathe and the characters a bit more depth.

Still, the actors inhabit their characters completely. The story is riveting. There is plenty of dramatic tension -- even though you know how the film will end if you are even vaguely familiar with the source material.

Villeneuve hasn't produced his masterpiece ... yet. I'm looking for a bit more depth and complexity. I understand that Dune Messiah -- which hasn't yet been approved by Warner, but which looks a certainty -- will provide that. Villeneuve, his actors and audience will get a chance to really unpack and dismantle the messiah myth. In any case, in Dune, parts one and two, Villeneuve and cast have planted the seeds for what could be sci-fi's top film trilogy of all time.",first word imax present i saw geneva switzerland balexert cinma certainli spectacular dolbi atmo present pretti earth shatter ear shatter action sequenc wear concert earplug prepar cover ear part film sinc perman hear damag risk volum level like present i saw a film bottom line the day watch dune part two i want watch i recent rewatch dune part one home system inch ole tv dolbi atmo soundbar i pick signific charact plot detail id miss initi view i expect i experi dune part two there lot film even hour minut thing miss the visual amaz no cgi artifact i could see contrast imax kong v godzilla trailer ran film incred worldbuild part one everyth appear natur even set strang otherworldli thi film without dull moment everi scene critic stori forward movement that movement relentless for problem not everyth explain satisfact these werent exactli plot hole rather plot ellips i hope villeneuv produc longer least h director cut give film bit room breath charact bit depth still actor inhabit charact complet the stori rivet there plenti dramat tension even though know film end even vagu familiar sourc materi villeneuv hasnt produc masterpiec yet im look bit depth complex i understand dune messiah hasnt yet approv warner look certainti provid villeneuv actor audienc get chanc realli unpack dismantl messiah myth in case dune part one two villeneuv cast plant seed could scifi top film trilog time

After so many years of being lectured by hollywood with poor scripts and miscast actors, Dune is a welcome reminder that all is not lost. Hopefully film studios take note and realise what happens when you trust a director and his team to understand source material and do their best to accurately put it on the big screen (although I will say that it wasn't 100% accurate).

"""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of Denis Villeneuve's epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic novel. With its sweeping visuals, gripping performances, and thought-provoking themes, it cements itself as a standout achievement in modern science fiction cinema.

From the sweeping deserts of Arrakis to the intricately designed sietches of the Fremen, every frame is imbued with a sense of otherworldly beauty and danger. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that each location feels distinct and alive, adding depth to an already immersive narrative.

For maximum immersion in ""Dune: Part Two,"" I really recommend watching detailed recap of its predecessor on youtube. Familiarity with the characters, factions, and events from the first part enriches the experience, improving understanding of the sequel's intricate plot and character dynamics.

"Okay, so let's just reign in this 'hype-train'... Now my rating is probably closer to an 8 (which in the way I rate movies on here, is very, very good) but I feel I just need to help settle down this average that is being blown all out of proportion. Don't get me wrong this movie looks and sounds incredible, but that is where the ""incredible"" ends. There are many sound bites and quotes flying around, which we all know are hand-picked or even 'funded' by the studio, that are going to lead you to believe this is the greatest film of all time...(It isn't). Or that Austin Butler has delivered us one of the greatest movie villains of all time...(He hasn't). These are merely part of the sales pitch. Unfortunately, when you deal with a project such as this that already has a massive following from the books there is no middle ground. The fans will destroy the movie or hail it as the greatest adaptation of all time. These fans, that hold the books in such high regard, feel a sense of ownership, as if they are trying to tell the world ""You see, we were right. You all called us nerds or geeks but now look...."" And they will shout longer and louder until everyone else agrees.

Like I said, this is a very good movie, but it is merely the middle.. (spoiler alert, there's gonna be another one!) Now unlike maybe The Dark Knight or Empire Strikes back, I don't know if this is something you would just watch randomly a few years on from now. You would have to set aside the time to make a dedicated effort to watch the whole saga. Which for me, removes it from the 'great movie' conversation.

A truly great movie should be something you can watch at the drop of a hat, something you can switch on halfway through and be instantly enthralled because you've seen them so many times. I just see that with this movie. Oppenheimer was the same. A fantastic film, but are you gonna stick it on when you've got a few hours to kill, while you wait for your solicitor to get back to you with the news of how much of your pension your soon-to-be ex wife wants in the divorce settlement...? No. You're gonna grab Flight of The Navigator off of the DVD shelf or City Slickers.

I digress. In a nutshell - Great visuals, incredible sound, some good performances although a missed opportunity with Butler's ""greatest movie villain of all time"". Pacing was a bit all over the place at times but overall a more than worthwhile next part to the story.

"I'll precursor this by saying 1) I have not read the books 2) I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan 3) I found part one underwhelming.

While I find there to be many issues with this film, perhaps its biggest weakness imo is that I hold no emotional connection with any of the characters, despite the film's lengthy runtime. The protagonist's mother is written as incredibly annoying, the villains are underused, Florence Pugh's character has 0 likability and acts simply as a story device. Bardem's character is OK and funny at times and Brolin doesn't have a standout moment. Zendaya's character is the sole exception to this, who is the beating heart of the film.

At times, I also felt that Chalamet, despite being an amazing actor, is perhaps miscast, though having not read the material, I cannot comment further on this.

The pacing felt off, as it stays too long in places it shouldn't, while sacrificing moments that could linger longer. This coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films. The movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats. The direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earned.

Perhaps the second biggest issue is that I do not totally buy into the world that has been created. It feels large but empty and lacking character. Almost too clean and strange for the sake of it. Style over substance. We stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesn't help. There were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the film.

With that said, there are a couple of epic moments that stood out, which are 1) the whole Zendaya bazooka scene and 2) the giant worm riding.

Overall, the film is enjoyable. However without engaging characters, a believable world, and pacing issues, the film falls short of greatness, perhaps way short.",ill precursor say i read book i huge deni villeneuv fan i found part one underwhelm while i find mani issu film perhap biggest weak imo i hold emot connect charact despit film lengthi runtim the protagonist mother written incred annoy villain underus florenc pugh charact likabl act simpli stori devic bardem charact ok funni time brolin doesnt standout moment zendaya charact sole except beat heart film at time i also felt chalamet despit amaz actor perhap miscast though read materi i cannot comment the pace felt stay long place shouldnt sacrif moment could linger longer thi come person enjoy long epic slow burn film the movi look outstand though feel closer connect rush stori beat the direct take main charact also feel earn perhap second biggest issu i total buy world creat it feel larg empti lack charact almost clean strang sake style substanc we stay time one two place doesnt help there also weird choic cut jump scene hamper flow film with said coupl epic moment stood whole zendaya bazooka scene giant worm ride overal film enjoy howev without engag charact believ world pace issu film fall short great perhap way short
"Absolutely incredible story and one of the best sequel movies that comes close to The Empire Strikes Back! Visual stunning thanks to the cinematography of Grieg Frasier. The visual effects and sound designs were amazing and shook the theater. The character dynamics between Paul and Chani from being star crossed lovers from different worlds slightly matches from the book but some story changes were made from the book as well, however it kept with the consistency with the narrative of the first film. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a magnum opus of a film and I'm hoping that he gets greenlit for Dune Messiah.",absolut incred stori one best sequel movi come close the empir strike back visual stun thank cinematographi grieg frasier the visual effect sound design amaz shook theater the charact dynam paul chani star cross lover differ world slightli match book stori chang made book well howev kept consist narr first film deni villeneuv craft magnum opu film im hope get greenlit dune messiah

But never really getting lost and pulled in to the story especially with the lack of good movies lately in cinema. It's very rare when a movie is so good that all I can do is just let go of all my own technical observations and truly just enjoy the story. With DUNE: part two I had no choice, it truly pulls you in deep, the story, the characters, everything that's going on around you disappears and all you can think about is what's going to happen next! This is how I know it's a good movie. I highly recommend watching this in the big screen. The music is outstanding. The story is extremely epic and satisfying to witness.

"Calling Dune Part 2 a masterpiece will be underselling the movie. Dune Part One establishes the world of Dune and its characters in a befitting manner. Part 2 carries all that built up tension and creates yet another magical experience that is perhaps the best adaptation of the book possible.

Denis Villeneuve is a magician. The way he brings the world to the screen is nothing short of magic. Each scene is a canvas. Each character chiseled with perfect craftsmanship. Each line of screenplay weaves the movie magic. Each action set piece deserves a standing ovation.

And the sound of Dune is an equal compatriot of the stunning visuals that this movie has. Each thumping noise to the whoosing noise of spice in the air bring Arrakis to life.

A movie adaptation that should be watched multiple times.",call dune part masterpiec undersel movi dune part one establish world dune charact befit manner part carri built tension creat yet anoth magic experi perhap best adapt book possibl deni villeneuv magician the way bring world screen noth short magic each scene canva each charact chisel perfect craftsmanship each line screenplay weav movi magic each action set piec deserv stand ovat and sound dune equal compatriot stun visual movi each thump nois whoos nois spice air bring arraki life a movi adapt watch multipl time

"What's all the hype about? I don't usually write reviews, but this movie is quite overrated. I'm a fan of games, I didn't read the books, but this movie is definitely worse than the first one, which I would rate a maximum of 8/10, which is pretty good. The second part is one movie cliché after another, not to mention the poor acting. Can we expect the same outcome as Game of Thrones? Well, this one didn't meet my expectations, but they were set pretty high after the first movie and all the buzz about the second one. I would say this is good for streaming services; it could have been an hour shorter (and possibly you wouldn't lose anything from the story).",what hype i dont usual write review movi quit overr im fan game i didnt read book movi definit wors first one i would rate maximum pretti good the second part one movi clich anoth mention poor act can expect outcom game throne well one didnt meet expect set pretti high first movi buzz second one i would say good stream servic could hour shorter possibl wouldnt lose anyth stori
"With the rise of streaming services and the quality of what is being put out from those platforms, it is most important if you are a fan of cinema to experience this movie in the next few weeks, potentially multiple times. Denis Villeneuve has accomplished a great task of bringing Dune to the big screen! The second part of the adaptation has only improved on the world building and visuals from the first. The story is rich and fast paced while not devolving into a convoluted and confusing mess. A few standouts of the story besides the obvious Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya were Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson. The movie left we wanting for more, even after its almost 3 hour runtime. If you want quality films to continue being made, Dune: Part Two is the film that will cement your admiration of this medium.",with rise stream servic qualiti put platform import fan cinema experi movi next week potenti multipl time deni villeneuv accomplish great task bring dune big screen the second part adapt improv world build visual first the stori rich fast pace devolv convolut confus mess a standout stori besid obviou timothe chalamet zendaya javier bardem rebecca ferguson the movi left want even almost hour runtim if want qualiti film continu made dune part two film cement admir medium
"Like Part 1, no complaints can be made about design or imagination. Unlike Part 1, the entire cast are off their game.

Chalamet works to either keep a perfectly flat Instagram-affect, or is barking in a comical Batman voice. Zendaya maintains a single expression throughout the entire film of anger/hurt/distrust. Any chemistry between the two of them in Part 1 is gone entirely here.

Pugh barely has any lines but reads the ones she has like she's in a police lineup. Pretty much everything hangs on Bardem, Who is the emotional rock the film rests on. Not because that's his role in the story, but because he's the only seemingly real person here.

The Emperor's role is to be weak, not to overshadow the Baron. As such, Walken is totally restrained, and functions as more of a look than anything else.

It's gorgeous, it's true to the books, some of the sequences are fantastic, I just felt completely detached from it at all times.",like part complaint made design imagin unlik part entir cast game chalamet work either keep perfectli flat instagramaffect bark comic batman voic zendaya maintain singl express throughout entir film angerhurtdistrust ani chemistri two part gone entir pugh bare line read one like she polic lineup pretti much everyth hang bardem who emot rock film rest not that role stori he seemingli real person the emperor role weak overshadow baron a walken total restrain function look anyth el it gorgeou true book sequenc fantast i felt complet detach time

"Dune: Part 2 is an incredibly satisfying follow-up to the far less exciting and interesting Part 1. While I was not blown away by Part 1, I would say it is a necessary prerequisite to enjoying Part 2. Is this movie so good that it's worth watching a second, lesser film in order to enjoy it? Yes, unequivocally.

While a lot of people are talking up Austin Butler's performance (and believe me, it is awesome), I really feel the shining star of the movie is Timothy Chalamet. Without giving too much away, he has to play almost 3 versions of the same character in this movie, and he frankly hits it out of the park in scenes I was expecting he'd be challenged by. Rebecca Ferguson is also spectacular; her character undergoes a significant change as well. Suffice to say, both Paul and his mom Jessica embrace some darker impulses in this one.

Visually, the movie is very impressive. One sequence that takes place off of Arrakis is particularly impressive in the way it is stylized. The sandworms are featured prominently and look great. One scene in particular involving a sandworm was shot practically and the realistic look of the scene really contributes to it as a highlight of the film.

Thematically, Dune 2 is about the toxicity of revenge turning good people bad, and the risk of blind faith turning humble folk into dangerous zealots.",dune part incred satisfi followup far less excit interest part while i blown away part i would say necessari prerequisit enjoy part is movi good worth watch second lesser film order enjoy ye unequivoc while lot peopl talk austin butler perform believ awesom i realli feel shine star movi timothi chalamet without give much away play almost version charact movi frankli hit park scene i expect hed challeng rebecca ferguson also spectacular charact undergo signific chang well suffic say paul mom jessica embrac darker impuls one visual movi impress one sequenc take place arraki particularli impress way styliz the sandworm featur promin look great one scene particular involv sandworm shot practic realist look scene realli contribut highlight film themat dune toxic reveng turn good peopl bad risk blind faith turn humbl folk danger zealot

"I watched Dune: Part Two last night in my local IMAX theater and when the credits rolled i was simply left speechless, i didn't wanna leave this universe.

The first Dune movie changed the way i look at movies, i along with everyone else were counting the days until we could finally sit down and take in this new chapter.

It did not disappoint.

Dune: Part Two is a spiritual experience. An absolute spectacle which kept my heart beating out of my chest for most of it.

Every single aspect of this movie deserves a lot of praise, from the astonishing visuals to the earth-shattering score, but if i have to focus on one thing i would say the performances. Everyone brought everything they had to this movie, this was a labor of love. Zendaya was incredible, balancing out the strength of Chani with the fragility of falling in love with this outsider, Paul and Chani's love was earned throughout the movie, subtly.

Timothée was...phenomenal. Larger than life. Oscar worthy performance, the authority, the intensity, he rose up to the moment.

I can't see how you can possibly give this movie a 10 out of 10. The visuals were good, but it was seriously lacking in action.

If you were a fan of the first movie it is worth going to see just to get closure on the story line. It had a lot more potential to be entertaining, but for me it just didn't deliver.

Absolutely no movement and completely boring yawnfest. What's happend to movies of late. Nothing exciting happening and zero excitement or suspense. Actors are 2nd rate and not memorable. What happend to real movies like Die Hard and Mad Max or even Naked Gun or White Chick's? The current state of cinema and movies is pretty bleak as everything seems to feel the need to include a political or current message about society. I think the last movie that actually had some backbone was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. That had all the right elements and took on some topics such as revenge and religion.,absolut movement complet bore yawnfest what happend movi late noth excit happen zero excit suspens actor nd rate memor what happend real movi like die hard mad max even nake gun white chick the current state cinema movi pretti bleak everyth seem feel need includ polit current messag societi i think last movi actual backbon three billboard outsid eb missouri that right element took topic reveng religion

"That Sums it up for me... i have not seen a movie yet that did an original book justice let alone surpass my imagination. The creators of theses two movies did just that. They visually and sonically expressed the story better than my mind could while reading it.

I understand you cannot put the complete story and world building in just 2,5 hours but. But even so the essence remaines and keeps the story going.

Dune elevates the art of book-to-film adaptations, a rare feat in capturing the essence of Frank Herbert's intricate universe. The meticulous craftsmanship extends to the characters, portrayed with depth and nuance. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the grandeur of its political intrigues. Hans Zimmer's score intensifies the emotional resonance, creating an immersive experience. Performances, especially from the stellar cast, bring authenticity to iconic characters.

"Masterfully directed by Denis Villeneuve, the first chapter of the cinematic adaptation of Frank Herbert's masterpiece, ""Dune,"" opens its doors to a vast and unsettling universe. With meticulous attention to detail and stunning aesthetics, Villeneuve brings to life on the big screen the landscapes of an atypical universe.

The film follows the story of Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timothée Chalamet), a young noble who becomes the key to crucial events as his family takes control of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, the only place in the universe where ""melange"" is found - a precious substance that affects the entire known world through its effects.

With an impressive ensemble cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, and Oscar Isaac as his father, Duke Leto Atreides, the film shapes its characters in a way that allows the audience to feel a deep connection with this fascinating world. Additionally, the performances of Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Dave Bautista as Glossu Rabban add an extra dimension of intensity and drama.

Villeneuve uses his remarkable directing skills to build a tense atmosphere full of mystery and danger. The magnificent visuals and hypnotic soundtrack contribute to creating a captivating and memorable cinematic experience.

The novel Dune, considered unfilmable and rightfully so, is somewhat minimalist in its portrayal, which might somewhat bother the ""purists"" of the book series, but the general impression is that Denis Villeneuve has done as much as possible in this regard given the constraints imposed by a film of maximum 3 hours.

With a brisk pace and a well-constructed narrative, ""Dune II"" follows Paul's rise amidst the desert tribes and his exploration of his prophetic powers, as well as his confrontation with the imperial and political forces seeking to control him.

Timothée Chalamet's performance is surprising, showing the complex evolution of his character as he discovers his true power and assumes his responsibilities as a leader. Meanwhile, the supporting characters continue to shine, and the remarkable acting performances of Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the most successful so far, add depth and emotional tension.

Visually, ""Dune II"" impresses with its epic battle scenes and stunning landscapes of the planet Arrakis, while the intense soundtrack contributes to amplifying the tense atmosphere.

""Dune I"" and ""Dune II"" represent not only two remarkable films but also an exceptional cinematic adaptation of a monumental literary work.

Perhaps a bit more could have been done; my fundamental reproach is that Villeneuve did not even explain through a reference the fundamental premise of the universe he describes, namely the Butlerian Jihad (the war against machines), an event that explains why the Dune universe looks the way it does, why there are no AIs or even computers, what was the fundamental role of spice, what the Guild was, and why it needed this substance found only on Dune, and so forth.",master direct deni villeneuv first chapter cinemat adapt frank herbert masterpiec dune open door vast unsettl univers with meticul attent detail stun aesthet villeneuv bring life big screen landscap atyp univers the film follow stori paul atreid portray timoth chalamet young nobl becom key crucial event famili take control planet arraki also known dune place univers melang found preciou substanc affect entir known world effect with impress ensembl cast includ rebecca ferguson paul mother ladi jessica oscar isaac father duke leto atreid film shape charact way allow audienc feel deep connect fascin world addit perform jason momoa duncan idaho dave bautista glossu rabban add extra dimens intens drama villeneuv use remark direct skill build ten atmospher full mysteri danger the magnific visual hypnot soundtrack contribut creat captiv memor cinemat experi the novel dune consid unfilm right somewhat minimalist portray might somewhat bother purist book seri gener impress deni villeneuv done much possibl regard given constraint impos film maximum hour with brisk pace wellconstruct narr dune ii follow paul rise amidst desert tribe explor prophet power well confront imperi polit forc seek control timoth chalamet perform surpris show complex evolut charact discov true power assum respons leader meanwhil support charact continu shine remark act perform stellan skarsgrd baron vladimir harkonnen success far add depth emot tension visual dune ii impress epic battl scene stun landscap planet arraki intens soundtrack contribut amplifi ten atmospher dune i dune ii repres two remark film also except cinemat adapt monument literari work perhap bit could done fundament reproach villeneuv even explain refer fundament premis univers describ name butlerian jihad war machin event explain dune univers look way ai even comput fundament role spice guild need substanc found dune forth
"The film ""Dune 2"" is a cinematographic work that impresses in several aspects. From the gripping soundtrack to the brilliant scenes and footage, the production captivates the viewer from start to finish. Timothée Chalamet's performance stands out, adding a layer of depth to the character.

When watching the movie, the experience is engaging and exciting. The expectations created by the critics are surpassed, leaving the public eager to review the work. The harmony between Villeneuve's vision and Hans Zimmer's music is remarkable, contributing to the immersion in the narrative.

In short, ""Dune 2"" is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in theaters. With impeccable performances, a striking soundtrack and stunning scenes, the production stands out as a true work of art.

"This is my first and only review. The film was so good i felt compelled to share my opinion. I saw the 1984 version and loved it as a kid so i was lookimg forward to see if the 2021 and it surpassed my expectations so much i feared part 2 would fail to deliver, but it delivered and so much more.the 2 hours 40 passed by in a jiffy.

"Dune: Part Two is on par with the first in nearly every aspect. However you felt about the first one is likely how you will feel about this sequel. It's a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine. Directing, cinematography and music are elite. And they continue to build the cast with great new additions.

But just like with Part One, the lack of story progression is noticeable. We don't get the ups and downs of a three-act structure. It feels like one act stretched out to 165 minutes. Again we don't seem to really have a climax. I didn't feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters. And I didn't entirely grasp character motivations, like why a character does something or why another is upset about it.

With Part One, I was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own. But now it's getting a little frustrating. Also, the PG-13 limitations are glaring.

"Where to begin... Wow. The scale of this movie surpasses everything: the action, the performances, the music; everything is perfect. The film picks up where the previous one left off to create what could feel like a war behind the screen. It feels so real; emotions flow throughout the projection, from beginning to end.

We witness Paul's growth to become the promised Messiah, and as he does, the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling.

Feyd-Rautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense; he is unpredictable and sadistic, truly relishing it, and Austin Butler portrays him magnificently. But the figure of Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet, feels like oppression itself, of a much more powerful and sinister evil, truly terrifying. Yet his more human side is not overlooked, as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders. To not dwell too much on interpretations, I must simply say that there is not a single one that disappoints; they are all truly magnificent.

Hans Zimmer picks up where he left off in the Part One and elevates it, providing a sense of epicness, without neglecting the mystique. The visuals are incomparable; the effects are polished to the smallest detail, making you believe in Dune, in Arrakis, and in the entire world built by Frank Herbert, and shown through Denis Villeneuve's vision.

Lastly, regarding this, it can only be said that this great director continues to improve; he always surprises for the better. With this film, he brings his sensitivity, which has already made him stand out, to tell the most epic story of his career, perhaps his greatest challenge, and he has succeeded; what seemed impossible, he has achieved.

I truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters; it was a sublime experience. I hope that, just like the book did in its own right, this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of Sci-Fi in cinema.",where begin wow the scale movi surpass everyth action perform music everyth perfect the film pick previou one left creat could feel like war behind screen it feel real emot flow throughout project begin end we wit paul growth becom promis messiah terrifi sensat caus sole idea come chill feydrautha terrifi explicit sen unpredict sadist truli relish austin butler portray magnific but figur paul play timoth chalamet feel like oppress much power sinist evil truli terrifi yet human side overlook see suffer fate fall upon shoulder to dwell much interpret i must simpli say singl one disappoint truli magnific han zimmer pick left part one elev provid sen epic without neglect mystiqu the visual incompar effect polish smallest detail make believ dune arraki entir world built frank herbert shown deni villeneuv vision lastli regard said great director continu improv alway surpris better with film bring sensit alreadi made stand tell epic stori career perhap greatest challeng succeed seem imposs achiev i truli feel fortun seen movi theater sublim experi i hope like book right movi becom benchmark propel futur scifi cinema

"Dune: Part Two is the sequel to the sci fi movie Dune by Denis Villeneuve, based on the book of the same title.

As an adaption, the movie does a good job delivering the story. It follows the book closely, though there were some differences that will probably be addressed in the third movie.

The action scenes, moreover, were spot on, with impressive shots. The movie also doesn't overdo it with its fighting scenes, having them evenly spread throughout the movie and just long enough to not tire the viewer, who would have to sit for a nearly three hour long film.

The performances were, in addition, great by everyone in the all start cast.

However, there were some things that were lacking. First of all, the romance wasn't convincing, with an odd pacing, and lack of chemistry between the leads.

Also, there way the unborn sister was presented was tiring after a while.

In addition, the movie seemed to lean more into the cinematography and impressing the audience, then focusing on the storytelling. Hence, for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie will leave them with a lot of plotholes and with one dimentional characters.

So, overall, seven out of ten, because it was visually pleasing, but not mesmerizing.",dune part two sequel sci fi movi dune deni villeneuv base book titl a adapt movi good job deliv stori it follow book close though differ probabl address third movi the action scene moreov spot impress shot the movi also doesnt overdo fight scene evenli spread throughout movi long enough tire viewer would sit nearli three hour long film the perform addit great everyon start cast howev thing lack first romanc wasnt convinc odd pace lack chemistri lead also way unborn sister present tire in addit movi seem lean cinematographi impress audienc focus storytel henc someon hasnt read book movi leav lot plothol one diment charact so overal seven ten visual plea mesmer
"The first movie I was excited about because I thought it did well in tracking with Frank Hurberts book. This second part looks like they said, ""to hell with the book,"" and they changed up the whole dynamic of the story to the extent that they have abandoned a lot of the concepts from the book in favor of current day politics and conceptions. I am very disappointed, I had to wait until it came out on video to watch it and 45 minutes in I don't even recognize it because even when they use elements from the book it is so turned around and distorted.

"This film is an epic, action-packed Sci-fi experience. Denis Villeneuve goes all out in this second part of what looks to be one of the best Sci-fi film series (if not one of the best film series) ever.

The film starts unpacking the amazing story of Dune where the previous film introduced us to. It is not neccesary to see part one to enjoy this film, but it definetly makes the experience more complete. Villeneuve took everything from part 1, but made it bigger and better.

Where the previous part was lacking on emotional level and action, this one completely makes up for it in it's 2 hours and 45 minutes runtime that feel less. It is filled with more depth in the story with as main point the struggle of Paul chosing between his foreseen destiny and his own loving desires, while getting revenge together with the Fremen for the brutal destruction of his family.

To top it off this film comes with a couple of plottwists that keep you at the edge of your seat, aswell as new characters portrayed by an amazing cast that give outstanding performances together with the great already known cast of Dune Part One.

All in all, this is a must watch for every film fan, especially in cinemas where Hans Zimmer takes you straight to Arrakis with his once again otherworldy, amazing score.

"Here is the best part about seeing Dune: Part Two in cinema-it almost didn't happen. It was the last day of the showing at my cinema, and my sister was late I wanted to experience this in the cinema and at last, I did and it was spectacular. It's funny how I have so many words, yet no words at all to describe the feeling of watching this masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve is one of a kind. His vision transcends into this, and please, I am begging you to give this man all awards ever.

It's visually special for sure, but the actors...well they act.

Timothée Chalamet once again proves that he is the leader of the new acting generation. He is mature and serious and we see his process of growing and changing.

Rebecca Ferguson & Austin Butler are probably two of the biggest standouts in this film (along with Chalamet. In every scene, they are in their command. I am looking forward to seeing Florence in the third part because she is the force.

Need to mention the score because wow, Hans Zimmer just won his second Oscar for this film.

"The best film of 2024, so far. It surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, especially in pacing, visual effects and action. The cast is even grander than its predecessor, talents such as Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walker, Lea Seydoux and Anya Taylor Joy were significant additions to make the narrative even more powerful. It is impossible not to comment on the action scenes, as in the first film there were few and not many were well directed, here Denis Villeneuve corrects this small flaw and delivers breathtaking action scenes, especially the large-scale war (holy war) of the third act of the film, which can easily be compared with the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings franchise.

"So, after the 1st part, I assumed they would make up for it in the 2nd part. However, the changes to the plotline are only there to facilitate a third episode, because there is no closure in the 2nd episode and there are missing elements.

I just can't forgive the total absence of the ""Weirding Way"". One of my favorite parts to the 1984 movie is when Paul doesn't even need a weirding module. (which isn't in the book). The glossing over of the Spacing Guild Navigators, and even their appearance is weak. The fact that spice is required for interstellar travel is also ignored so that a horrible, unnecessary choice is made near the end of the movie. Alia's contributions are mostly missing as are some of Paul's interactions with the Bene Gesserit. The fight between Paul and Feyd is less dramatic.

The big scenes are well shot and beautiful. Not all of the plot changes are bad. I thought the more time spent on opposing factions within the Fremen was good and more realistic.

Bottom line, in spite of the few improvements, I felt there was less drama, and many lapses. I like the 1984 film better.",so st part i assum would make nd part howev chang plotlin facilit third episod closur nd episod miss element i cant forgiv total absenc weird way one favorit part movi paul doesnt even need weird modul isnt book the gloss space guild navig even appear weak the fact spice requir interstellar travel also ignor horribl unnecessari choic made near end movi alia contribut mostli miss paul interact bene gesserit the fight paul feyd less dramat the big scene well shot beauti not plot chang bad i thought time spent oppos faction within fremen good realist bottom line spite improv i felt less drama mani lap i like film better

During the entire time I was shivering, feeling goosebumps and in the edge of my seat.

I already enjoyed the first movie, giving it a nice 8/10 or 7.5/10 but the part two is one of those rare cases where the second film is actually better than the first, and in my opinion by a mile, because this is just a goated film and one of my favorites too, it's in my top 5 easily.

Acting was really really good almost flawless.

The CGI was goated, really good effects and the explosions were breathtaking.

The songs/soundtracks were insane, another Hans Zimmer classic.

"My imagination has come to life on the screen. I didn't think it was possible. The books were profound and intricate. The film just about did it justice with the caveat that it didn't have time to go into detail about the effect of the Water of Life on Paul's unborn sister Alia. This has obviously left the door open for another film! Riding the Worms was something you could only dream about and there it was! Right before my eyes! Fabulous and euphoric. The characters are perfectly imagined and portrayed. The tension in the screenplay was palpable, so much so, I couldn't speak for a while when the film ended. Film?! That word hardly expresses the experience. It was reality. It surrounded and enveloped you, plunging you into the world of Arrakis.

"People rating this above 8 most probably never read the book - something I did more than 10 times over the last 15 years. This was always, at least for me, one of the sci-fi masterpieces with a storyline that was almost sacred.

Part 1 was sublime in terms of character development, pace and adherence to the storyline. Compared with this, Part 2 a dismal failure of discrete battle scenes, one dimensional characters and a serious deviation from the storyline. In my view, they tried to stretch the success of the first movie into a third installment for commercial reasons and in the process butchered Part 2.

"Dune Part Two is the sequel to the very successful Dune adaptation. The story picks up right where we left off in the first film. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) unite with the Fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family. Paul must prove himself as the so called messiah, the ""Lisan al Gaib"", to unite the different Fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power. He alongside Chani (Zendaya), a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest, will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal Harkonnens.

I'll start by saying this surpasses the first film. The depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first. The first act mainly gives time for Paul and Chani's relationship development. It follows Paul's trials to becoming Fremen (with a particular scene in mind that I won't spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film). You are also introduced to new characters like the Emperor played by the legendary Christopher Walken and Princess Irulan played by Florence Pugh, who both are excellent in the film. This is only the first act.

The Dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully. Two performances that stood out for me were Javier Bardem and Austin Butler's ""Stilgar"" and ""Feyd-Rautha"". Props to Javier for including here some awesome comedic timing. His subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh, and it works for me so well because it is unexpected. On the other hand, Austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor, terrifying but amazing.

Each character is further explored and given time to shine. If the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the Dune universe to the viewers, this film is more about our character's development and arcs.

The score of this film somehow got even better than the first one. So much emotion and love was given here. Furthermore, I recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both Dune films is the same one who worked on films which I love like ""The Batman"" and ""The Creator"". Greig Fraser's capture of shots in Dune Part Two will blow your mind. Oscar worthy. The shots that stand out for me are the wide shots. They are glorious. With the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, the angelic beauty of Greig Fraser's shots and of course the direction of Denis Villeneuve, you are left with a masterpiece.

This film is truly a triumph of cinema. In all honesty, I would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but I am also good with them leaving it the way it is. I am fulfilled by the ending and entertained to my core.

"It's true that the trailer made me hope for a great film, beautiful and spectacular, but I had the impression of watching magnificent shots one after another.

It's true that it's beautiful, apart sometimes from the overabundance of special effects which taint the original shots.

Unfortunately, I didn't feel any emotion, no suspense, no fear, no sadness, nothing... it's flat.

The actors play correctly but nothing sensational either. And apart from the last music of the film, I did not find the soundtrack extraordinary.

So I think it must be seen, it remains visually very beautiful, and therefore this film must be seen in the cinema to enjoy it, and if possible in Imax Digital since it was filmed in 70mm.

Of course, it's a film that must lose intensity on television and therefore seeing it in the cinema seems essential to me. In my opinion, it will not remain a great film.",it true trailer made hope great film beauti spectacular i impress watch magnific shot one anoth it true beauti apart sometim overabund special effect taint origin shot unfortun i didnt feel emot suspens fear sad noth flat the actor play correctli noth sensat either and apart last music film i find soundtrack extraordinari so i think must seen remain visual beauti therefor film must seen cinema enjoy possibl imax digit sinc film mm of cours film must lose intens televis therefor see cinema seem essenti in opinion remain great film
"Christopher Nolan described the film as Denis' The Empire Strikes Back and once you see the film, you understand why... It's an absolute cinematic masterpiece! A film that stuns you with its cinematography, gives you goosebumps with its music and leaves you in awe with its performances.

Denis Villeneuve's filmography and how it gets better with every film is simply remarkable, and probably he's got the best one yet with Dune Part Two. His sense of direction and his vision for the film and franchise is beyond anything and it shows... you can see the grandiosity, and yet the stillness in so many of the scenes.

The story (for those who aren't aware) keeps getting bigger as it progresses, and the film keeps levelling up! The silence is golden because then the shots can speak more than the dialogue. There are also scenes which amp you up like nothing else.

Alongside that ride, is Grieg Fraser with the best cinematography you can see on the big screen, especially the IMAX screen. Every frame is a treat to watch, the details, the scenes, everything. There's no small or big scene here, everything is a cinematic experience, the still scenes and the magnanimous moments.

Timothee Chalamet is showcasing his best work here and we aren't talking about it enough already... There's a stillness, and stoicism in his performance, but also ferocity and hunger, the combination of elements that bring out the best of him on the screen and elevate his performance.

While Zendaya's role seemed more of a supporting one, rather than a lead one, it is an important role where much of her performance is through her eyes more than anything else... and there's so much power in that.

You cannot talk about Dune Part Two and not talk about Rebecca Ferguson, her command over her character and the power-packed performance she has delivered, you're in awe every time she's on screen.

Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and Josh Brolin are all exceptional... but there's another standout name that yet again delivers brilliantly, Austin Butler. What a scene-stealer! His voice, his look, his personality, a fiery role in this already exceptional cast.

The impact Dune Part Two makes is incomplete without the music of Hans Zimmer. Literal goosebumps are what you're able to feel, the elevation that it brings to the scenes and how you're able to feel what's about to come only with the music is extraordinary.

There are some films when you say, ""This is Cinema""... and this is one of them. In such instances, even if there are a few flaws here and there, you don't want to notice them when everything else is so good and so many elements are appreciable at such high capacity.

"Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction epic, Dune has been rewritten and filmed many times. And there are others planned for the future.

However, it is necessary to watch this new release for comparison. Yes, the story and even the pronunciation of words vary from the book. However, for those that have not read the book some parts of the movie you will not like are right out of the book.

The cast alone is worth watching and even though you tend to say, ""Now where have I seen that actor before,"" the actor does not stand out past the character they are portraying.

The total abscence of the fj agenda makes this movie a gem.",frank herbert classic sciencefict epic dune rewritten film mani time and other plan futur howev necessari watch new releas comparison ye stori even pronunci word vari book howev read book part movi like right book the cast alon worth watch even though tend say now i seen actor actor stand past charact portray the total abscenc fj agenda make movi gem
"Let me just say this, I watched this with 2 friends. We were having really big hopes and when it's ended, we were like that's it?

It is established, that you can't put on film a complex book. On film you have narrow the focus on and dumb it down, especially fi you want it to be successful for the masses. But extraordinary writers and directors manage to do that and with their magical skills to give you a lot more.

This is a movie with beautiful scenery, music and sound effects and average anything else.

From my perspective, Jessica was made weak for some reason and she supposed to be a perfectly trained Bene Gesserit, when so was throwing up, I was like not ... she has perfect control on her body, she has inhuman reflexes and can even control her body ad microscopic levels not to mention her mind is a fortress.

Mentats strategic mind,politics, religion, Arrakis terraforming, Freemen mastering their environment. A strange universe where humans have super specialized abilities that we can only dream of. Is not really present here.

And lets get to the actions and fighting, is really a bore. There iare a few basic premises. Fights are with guns, if shield then you move to low speed fighting, lasers rock but shield with lasers =nuke. And we get one scene of attacking a harvester, tens of femens being killed, so they can kill the ornithopter as it had a shield and then they use lasers, logical, but next scenes lasers used with ornithopters flying around, logicless.

Next, sword fighting everywhere, like its some fantasy movie. And fremens jumping aroudn like acrobats, killing saurdaukars like they were flies. This was really annoying, fremen are tigh knit community, survivors in a sand world, with really good fighting skills. Sardaukars are product of hell world, were everything tried to kill them since they were babies, trained from infancy to soldiering,tactics and battle. Only the best survive and reach sardaukar elite status. And they have the best equipment. In this movie, they are idiots, running around like headless chickens. Pathetic!

And we fast forward to an end, that's truly lame.

"He loves setting the mood, and oh lord, he does it well. But he does it too much.

This movie, just like the others he directed, needs a bunch of cuts.... Paul keeps looking at Chani over and over again. We understand, we don't need you to remind us seven times in the scene.

A lot of scenes are too exhausted, too long. I'd remove maybe more than 30 minutes of excessive and repetitive ""mood setting scenes"". Seriously, great music, powerful visuals, awesome designs...

"Dune: Part Two is the greatest example of why movie theaters will never die. Going to the theaters and seeing a movie is an event, and it should be entertaining and enjoyable enough to leave a lasting impact. Dune: Part Two does exactly this in a runtime that would be considered long, but never once slows down or loses its quality. The main cast in this film in excellent-Chalamet, Ferguson, Zendaya and Butler deliver top-tier performances that I believe will get their own recognition at next year's academy awards.

Villeneuve has already proven to be a fantastic director, but I think he has the chance to be the greatest science fiction director of all time. With films like this and part one, The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049-I think it's safe to say we are in great hands and hopefully the content of the Dune Saga will only grow, and I trust Villeneuve to deliver another excellent picture with Dune Messiah and his next couple of films.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself the favor of seeing it on the biggest possible screen you can with the best sound. It really enhances the film and its visuals, score and sound. Without movie theaters, we would never get films as grand and epic as this one is, and I don't think anyone should miss out on the opportunity to see this adaptation of Frank Herbert's magnum opus.",dune part two greatest exampl movi theater never die go theater see movi event entertain enjoy enough leav last impact dune part two exactli runtim would consid long never slow lose qualiti the main cast film excellentchalamet ferguson zendaya butler deliv toptier perform i believ get recognit next year academi award villeneuv alreadi proven fantast director i think chanc greatest scienc fiction director time with film like part one the arriv blade runner i think safe say great hand hope content dune saga grow i trust villeneuv deliv anoth excel pictur dune messiah next coupl film if havent seen movi yet plea favor see biggest possibl screen best sound it realli enhanc film visual score sound without movi theater would never get film grand epic one i dont think anyon miss opportun see adapt frank herbert magnum opu
"Dune is a very hard book to capture on the screen, so this was a monumental accomplishment.

The movie captures the atmosphere of the universe very well and is cinematographically very nice. The movie stays pretty true to the book; I read the book when I was 14 years of age. To be honest, most of the movie is how I more-or-less imagined things to look like in my mind.

The dialogue on this movie is a little dry. Not everything is thoroughly explained which the books probably do a better job of. Some characters could have used more development but I don't remember if that's an issue with the source material.

This movie follows the general recent trend of improving movie quality in cinema, after about a decade or so of Marvel dominance. It is unique, artistic, and detailed, and tackles a large scale project.",dune hard book captur screen monument accomplish the movi captur atmospher univers well cinematograph nice the movi stay pretti true book i read book i year age to honest movi i moreorless imagin thing look like mind the dialogu movi littl dri not everyth thoroughli explain book probabl better job some charact could use develop i dont rememb that issu sourc materi thi movi follow gener recent trend improv movi qualiti cinema decad marvel domin it uniqu artist detail tackl larg scale project
"I do t get it, the movie was epic and stunning to watch, but it lacked plot and agency.

It feels like the first thing that happened was after the first hour. If I walked into the cinema after one hour, I wouldn't have missed a single point of the story.

There was even a great recap of the first movie in part 2, so that I almost didn't need to have watched it.

With the slow walk to the predictable point of no return, the movie still managed to feel very rushed in the end.

At the base it was a great story, but way too long. Why even spend so long time with side characters that doesn't impact the movie much?

This is a movie that actually could have used a montage of character development instead of the torture of time just passing by.",i get movi epic stun watch lack plot agenc it feel like first thing happen first hour if i walk cinema one hour i wouldnt miss singl point stori there even great recap first movi part i almost didnt need watch with slow walk predict point return movi still manag feel rush end at base great stori way long whi even spend long time side charact doesnt impact movi much thi movi actual could use montag charact develop instead tortur time pas
"Dune: Part Two accomplishes more things than any Sci-Fi epic in the last 20 years. It not only effectively conveys the plot of the novel, but does so with great emotional density. The performances are top notch across the board. Timothee Chalamet cements his legacy as a true star, showing a wide range of emotional capital. And as far as the visuals, the film has no equal. The worm-riding sequence is one of the most awe-inspiring moments of any movie I've ever seen. The music and sound design are perfect.

"Like the first film of this two part adaptation of Frank Hebert's sci-fi classic, 'Dune: Part Two' was a very mixed bag for me. On a technical level it's brilliant. Easily one of the best looking films of this century. If nothing else, director Denis Villeneuve sure knows how to shoot a movie. I just wish he were better at telling a story.

His 'Blade Runner 2049' was also gorgeous, but it suffered from being cold, soulless and without any real sense of purpose. Unlike the latter, 'Dune: Part Two' has a purpose (thanks to whatever is left here from Frank Herbert's vision), but it also lacks any semblance of emotion or genuine humanity. It somehow manages to be both epic and flat. Quite a feat, but not one to be proud of.

The film is also tragically miscast. Timothée Chalamet finally starts to rise to the occasion in fits and starts once he becomes ""the one"", but everyone besides Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem are just dreadful. Enough can't be said about how awful Zendaya is here. Even in her wheelhouse she has the range of a spitball, but she's in way, way over her skis on this one. And don't get me started on Christopher Walken as the Emperor. Christopher Walken?! Are you kidding me! This needed an actor with some gravitas and regality. Walken feels far too contemporary for this sort of thing.

Look, 'Dune' is my favorite novel of all-time, and my cool reaction to the first part of this adaptation is why it took me nearly six months to watch this. It's not the changes that bother me, save for the ending with Chani, which is an unforgivable sin in my opinion.

"I saw Dune: Part 2 last night and was up very late afterwards thinking about what I'd just experienced... I can't imagine it being possible to adapt the Frank Herbert's 1965 novel into film any better than Denis Villeneuve has done. It's a highly-refined masterpiece, a monumental achievement in science fiction that's brimming with thematic complexity. Movies like this should be a wake-up call to Hollywood, encouraging the industry to take more risk and let the creative geniuses (like Denis) cook without compromise.

The Hans Zimmer soundtrack, eye-watering cinematography, gorgeous visuals, top-notch acting and intricate storyline were all woven into perfection. Every shot is teeming with life. There wasn't a dull part about Dune 2, from the moment the bass induced voice boomed through my lungs to the end credits, I felt completely captivated.

"Dune, part 2 stands as a visually stunning sequel that adeptly continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless sci-fi masterpiece. Led by the talented Timothée Chalamet, the cast delivers captivating performances, with Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides particularly mesmerizing as he navigates the complexities of his destiny. The film's breathtaking visuals, intricate production design, and seamless special effects immerse viewers in the vast and unforgiving landscape of Arrakis.

Beyond its visual spectacle, Dune, part 2 delves deep into rich thematic layers, exploring the intricate interplay of politics, religion, ecology, and identity within a sprawling galactic conflict. Each scene is laden with symbolism, inviting audiences to ponder the broader implications of the narrative's themes.

Moreover, the film is a thrilling adventure from start to finish, punctuated by epic battles, suspenseful sequences, and poignant moments that resonate with emotion.

I've seen a lot of movies in my life and this one here is damn near perfect.the pacing is good, a little better then the first one. It's a must see in theaters for the experience. So excited to see where they take the movie next. I loved that they started the movie right off where they left it at, and the surprises of certain characters, and how certain character arch's are played out in this movie was handled greatly. You can really tell that they were set out to make a masterpiece and not another cookie cutter movie filled with familiar tropes like what they end up doing to Star Wars. 10/10 for me.

I was utterly captivated by the stunning display before me.

The meticulous attention to detail, the incredible sound effects and music, the exquisite cinematography, and the superb performances.

I felt an immediate urge to return to the IMAX theater for another viewing.

It's evident that Denis Villeneuve poured his heart and soul into this project.

The Soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is just the cherry on top!

Don't miss out on seeing it, you will not regret it!

"I've never given a perfect score as I don't believe perfection can ever be achieved yet Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the incredibly complex and convoluted world of Dune is pure genius. It's better than 9 stars. When I go to see any movie version of a book it is with the low expectations of hoping to see something reasonably close to the writer's vision. Villeneuve, however, makes major revisions to the story line and its focus and yet weaves all the depth and meaning Frank Herbert crafted into his story in a little over two hour viewing time. And the cinematography is stunning. A masterpiece by one of today's best directors.",ive never given perfect score i dont believ perfect ever achiev yet deni villeneuv adapt incred complex convolut world dune pure geniu it better star when i go see movi version book low expect hope see someth reason close writer vision villeneuv howev make major revis stori line focu yet weav depth mean frank herbert craft stori littl two hour view time and cinematographi stun a masterpiec one today best director
"Denis Villeneuve has managed something that is very rare : a sequel that is better than the original movie.

Dune: Part Two joins The Empire Strikes Back and the Godfather in that rare list.

The way Arrakis is brought to live on the screen (and Giedi Prime...OMG) is simply magical, and the sheer scale of the project results in in not just a big blockbuster but a piece of art.

There is not one moment that the movie doesn't ring through, and the performances, the visuals, the sound, the music and the effects all come together very organically.

Denis Villeneuve has now made 3 or 4 Sci-Fi masterpieces in a row (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and Dune I and II). Looking forward to seeing what else this magician can pull out of his hat next time.",deni villeneuv manag someth rare sequel better origin movi dune part two join the empir strike back godfath rare list the way arraki brought live screen giedi primeomg simpli magic sheer scale project result big blockbust piec art there one moment movi doesnt ring perform visual sound music effect come togeth organ deni villeneuv made scifi masterpiec row arriv blade runner dune i ii look forward see el magician pull hat next time

"""It's something is not broken don't fix it"" the story was a literary masterpiece! One of, if not the greatest science fiction novels of all time. The acting was amazing. The special effects amazing. The costume and environmental design were perfect. But the was change so much! A fictional universe such as this is so complex that when you change key things the story won't make sense. Paul and chain's relationship was changed, the time line of the story was changed, main characters were not even in the movie (Thufir Hawat, Count Fenring, Alia Atreides who is Paul's sister who should have been born during this movie and was the character who actually killed the Barron.) They have completely changed the story from what it should be i understand into today's climate you must cater to the most democratic. It's just a shame that literary and intellectual masterpiece such as this wasn't treated the way it should be.

Overall the movie was awesome, for someone who has no knowledge of the novel it is a must watch.

"So Villeneuve is my favorite current-working director, and when I saw all the great ratings and reviews for this movie, I was excited about it thinking it must have improved on everything that was wrong with the first Dune movie. But unfortunately, the only thing that improved here was the visuals and the action, and they were fine even in the first movie too.

I rewatched the first Dune again before watching this because I didn't remember much from the first time I watched it 3 years ago. And I think I understood the story of the first movie better this time, but my overall enjoyment of the first movie and feelings about it were the exact same; it's a decent introduction to this universe and characters, but lacks the needed emotional connection of the viewer with the characters, and the characterization needs a lot of work. (And obviously, the story suddenly ending) When I reviewed the first movie, I said hopefully a second movie would be made to complete the story and give a better characterization to these characters. But sadly, this movie continued with the same shallow characterization problem as the first film.

These movies aren't short either, they are nearly 3 hours, so they have all the time in the world to make you care about these characters and flesh them out. But most of the time is spent on ""cool"" visuals and action scenes. And don't get me wrong, the visuals are amazing, absolutely 10/10 visuals and cinematography. But the storytelling and characterization here is 6/10 or 7/10 at best. So how can a movie be a ""masterpiece"" if only the visuals are good but the story is lacking?

Many people compare these movies to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and that actually highlights the problems of this movie and also reinforces what a miracle it was that the LOTR trilogy turned out the way it was and no one has been able to reproduce the magic of those movies, not even Peter Jackson himself.

Comparing Dune to LOTR, you'll realize how much thought and work had gone into making LOTR and its characters relatable, easily making the audience familiar with these characters, and allowing them to form a great emotional connection to them. LOTR was written as an adaptation that the book-readers can enjoy, and the audience who hadn't read the books could also watch and still get the story and understand the characters and their motivations. You don't need to read the books to understand every character in the movie and why they did what they did, or having to read to make an emotional connection to them. The films already did those things masterfully.

But Dune? It definitely is a movie that's made for people who are already familiar with the universe and have already read the books. It's like a summary with cool action montages of the important plot points that leaves out the character-building and much-needed parts to make the audience understand the character arc of Paul Atreides.

Attack on Titan did that with Eren Yeager and you could understand the transformation of this protagonist throughout the story. But in this movie, Paul just changes suddenly toward the end of the movie and the movie does a poor job of justifying that. Instead of giving more time to flesh out this plot point and show what happened and show a gradual change in Paul, we are mostly shown cool visual effects and unimportant scenes with the villains that do nothing to help these antagonists become more than cartoonishly evil one-dimensional characters.

And I understand that Attack on Titan is a long anime/manga and definitely had a lot more time to make you care about its characters compared to two movies that are only over 2 hours. And I also understand that Dune is apparently a really difficult book to adapt to a visual medium, and that it's a miracle these two movies even turned out as decent as they did. But like I said, LOTR already proved that you can have the cool visuals, but also have the depth, good storytelling, and great characterization in your movie too.

Denis Villeneuve has said that he made Dune for himself, fulfilling his childhood wish. And as nice of a sentiment that sounds, that is the problem with Dune. It's made for himself and those who already know this story. It's not made for someone who wants to get to know this world and characters for the first time via the movies.

And like I said, it's not only the protagonists that suffer from a lack of good characterization so the audience can have an emotional connection to them. The villains even lack more. The introduction of Feyd-Rautha and the gladiator arena scene are definitely some of the most unique and iconic scenes in any movie I've ever seen. It shows you that ""yeah, this guy doesn't eff around and is different"" very well. But what happens after that? He just becomes another ""bad guy who eats an apple with a knife and randomly kills his own henchmen because they said hello to him"". Not to mention they don't show what he does differently than Rabban that makes him better and more dangerous. The only thing he does is shoot missiles at the Fremen, and Baron calls it ""genius""? Really? If it was so easy, why couldn't Rabban do it before? Not to mention how disappointing Baron's character is too. You'd think he's an intimidating and powerful villain when watching the first movie, but you're gonna be unpleasantly disappointed by him in this one.

And it is sad because Villeneuve actually knows how to write good ""human"" characters and make the audience have an emotional connection with them. He's not Nolan. He's already shown he knows how to write good characters the audience can relate to with Incendies, Arrival, Prisoners, and many more. So I don't know if it was a deliberate choice or he was restricted from making the movie longer and had to cut a lot of scenes that fleshed out these characters more.

So I talked a lot about the negatives and I don't want to repeat myself and only talk about the problems I had with it. I still give the movie a 7 because the visuals and the music are too good to give it lower, but I could even give it a 6 because of the story.

So 7/10 is still not bad, but considering the rating and the raving, I expected more.

Like I said, the cinematography, the direction for the most part, the music, and the action are all 10/10 here and it's a quality blockbuster that more blockbusters should try to follow, but not the storytelling part though.

The movie is enjoyable and I didn't really find it boring, though some scenes could've been cut out or dedicated to better flesh out the story and characters. But it's a decent continuation of the first film.

When the movie came out and received all the great reviews and ratings, I kept seeing some people saying they liked the first Dune better and I was really confused about how they could like the first movie more if everyone was saying this one is a masterpiece and better in every way. But after finally watching it myself, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first Dune more too, and I can't believe I liked this one less. Don't get me wrong, the first Dune also greatly suffers from characterization and better storytelling, but it was still a more coherent story than this film's.

Overall, it's not a bad movie, but massively disappointed me, especially after seeing the great ratings and reviews it received. It's a movie that's mainly made for the people who've already read the books and know these characters, and they can enjoy these movies more than your average movie-watcher who isn't familiar with this story and characters. I have the same emotional connection to these characters as I did before knowing them for the first time. 10/10 visuals and action, 6/10 storytelling and characterization.",so villeneuv favorit currentwork director i saw great rate review movi i excit think must improv everyth wrong first dune movi but unfortun thing improv visual action fine even first movi i rewatch first dune watch i didnt rememb much first time i watch year ago and i think i understood stori first movi better time overal enjoy first movi feel exact decent introduct univers charact lack need emot connect viewer charact character need lot work and obvious stori suddenli end when i review first movi i said hope second movi would made complet stori give better character charact but sadli movi continu shallow character problem first film these movi arent short either nearli hour time world make care charact flesh but time spent cool visual action scene and dont get wrong visual amaz absolut visual cinematographi but storytel character best so movi masterpiec visual good stori lack mani peopl compar movi the lord ring trilog actual highlight problem movi also reinforc miracl lotr trilog turn way one abl reproduc magic movi even peter jackson compar dune lotr youll realiz much thought work gone make lotr charact relat easili make audienc familiar charact allow form great emot connect lotr written adapt bookread enjoy audienc hadnt read book could also watch still get stori understand charact motiv you dont need read book understand everi charact movi read make emot connect the film alreadi thing master but dune it definit movi that made peopl alreadi familiar univers alreadi read book it like summari cool action montag import plot point leav characterbuild muchneed part make audienc understand charact arc paul atreid attack titan eren yeager could understand transform protagonist throughout stori but movi paul chang suddenli toward end movi movi poor job justifi instead give time flesh plot point show happen show gradual chang paul mostli shown cool visual effect unimport scene villain noth help antagonist becom cartoonishli evil onedimension charact and i understand attack titan long animemanga definit lot time make care charact compar two movi hour and i also understand dune appar realli difficult book adapt visual medium miracl two movi even turn decent but like i said lotr alreadi prove cool visual also depth good storytel great character movi deni villeneuv said made dune fulfil childhood wish and nice sentiment sound problem dune it made alreadi know stori it made someon want get know world charact first time via movi and like i said protagonist suffer lack good character audienc emot connect the villain even lack the introduct feydrautha gladiat arena scene definit uniqu icon scene movi ive ever seen it show yeah guy doesnt eff around differ well but happen he becom anoth bad guy eat appl knife randomli kill henchman said hello not mention dont show differ rabban make better danger the thing shoot missil fremen baron call geniu realli if easi couldnt rabban not mention disappoint baron charact youd think he intimid power villain watch first movi your gonna unpleasantli disappoint one and sad villeneuv actual know write good human charact make audienc emot connect he nolan he alreadi shown know write good charact audienc relat incendi arriv prison mani so i dont know deliber choic restrict make movi longer cut lot scene flesh charact so i talk lot neg i dont want repeat talk problem i i still give movi visual music good give lower i could even give stori so still bad consid rate rave i expect like i said cinematographi direct part music action qualiti blockbust blockbust tri follow storytel part though the movi enjoy i didnt realli find bore though scene couldv cut dedic better flesh stori charact but decent continu first film when movi came receiv great review rate i kept see peopl say like first dune better i realli confus could like first movi everyon say one masterpiec better everi way but final watch i honestli say i enjoy first dune i cant believ i like one less dont get wrong first dune also greatli suffer character better storytel still coher stori film overal bad movi massiv disappoint especi see great rate review receiv it movi that mainli made peopl whove alreadi read book know charact enjoy movi averag moviewatch isnt familiar stori charact i emot connect charact i know first time visual action storytel character
"Less than 0.1% of Earth's human population will agree with me. You are all going to think I am a weak, stupid panzee who needs to shut up. There are two main problems with this movie; the message and the violence.

The message says; fight and kill at all costs to preserve yourself, slaughter and humiliate your enemies, use people's beliefs to control them, and be a good leader by ruling through fear. In the Dune universe, it is the year 10,191, humans (and humanoids) have STILL not learned to work together. The movie is a great representation of today's world, with all the kingdoms of the earth deceiving and fighting one another, trying to be the king of the hill even if the rest of the world must suffer, except, in the movie, it is just more brutal and barbaric than the slow politics of today's world.

Unfortunately, because of the big name actors and all the money made to promote the film, it's ""critically acclaimed"". Back when I was a teenager, I would have loved this movie, but I now, I have come to learn that violence and country nationalism is preventing us from actually making the world a better place.

I could go on, but no one is reading this far into my review.",less earth human popul agre you go think i weak stupid panze need shut there two main problem movi messag violenc the messag say fight kill cost preserv slaughter humili enemi use peopl belief control good leader rule fear in dune univers year human humanoid still learn work togeth the movi great represent today world kingdom earth deceiv fight one anoth tri king hill even rest world must suffer except movi brutal barbar slow polit today world unfortun big name actor money made promot film critic acclaim back i teenag i would love movi i i come learn violenc countri nation prevent u actual make world better place i could go one read far review
"I'm now a huge fan. Part 1 was good but a bit too slow but Timothée Chalamet performance was outstanding.

Part one gives us a small glance at what's coming and kept us waiting eagerly.

I'll try to review avoiding any spoiler.

Now onto part 2. It started a bit slow again. Seems like some of the events of the first hour should have been in part one but again we keep learning how Paul gets his legendary status and support.

But the second part of the movie is glorious. We have so many great characters and development all over the place. The final battle is exciting, effects are awesome and soundtrack was on track.

This is probably the great work of this generation and my kid was excited with the whole story and universe. I wish they would have given us some of the hints of what's coming but I'm happy on how it ended.

I'm not loving Zendaya in this film. I feel her acting range is not suited for this one as she's the weaker cast in this film. Everyone else is very involved in their character but she's so plain and linear and doesn't match how great Timothée performs here.

Can't wait for the next deliveries. I'm definitely going to see this movie several times as we need to support good movies when they appear. 10/10 and fully recommended.",im huge fan part good bit slow timoth chalamet perform outstand part one give u small glanc what come kept u wait eagerli ill tri review avoid spoiler now onto part it start bit slow seem like event first hour part one keep learn paul get legendari statu support but second part movi gloriou we mani great charact develop place the final battl excit effect awesom soundtrack track thi probabl great work gener kid excit whole stori univers i wish would given u hint what come im happi end im love zendaya film i feel act rang suit one she weaker cast film everyon el involv charact she plain linear doesnt match great timoth perform cant wait next deliveri im definit go see movi sever time need support good movi appear fulli recommend
"Experiencing this sequel was a revelation, offering an immersion into a universe that rivals the depth and complexity of the most acclaimed fantasy series. The film's intricate world and narrative grandeur strongly suggest revisiting its predecessor, although its standalone prowess equally engages both longstanding fans and newcomers. Denis Villeneuve's directorial genius shines, making a compelling case for his stewardship over such epic narratives.

Surpassing its prequel, the sequel boasts a mesmerizing score by Hans Zimmer, alongside unparalleled technical mastery in visual effects and cinematography, setting new benchmarks. The narrative weaves deeper character arcs while introducing captivating new figures, all amidst jaw-dropping action that leaves a lasting impression.

This film not only concludes the journey begun earlier but also skillfully lays the groundwork for future explorations in this saga. Anticipation for its sequel, ""Dune: Messiah,"" is high, with hopes it will further elevate the genre in upcoming awards seasons, challenging prevailing biases against fantasy/sci-fi narratives.

An IMAX viewing is recommended to fully appreciate this cinematic masterpiece, poised to become a genre-defining classic. This sequel comes highly recommended, promising an unforgettable cinematic experience.",experienc sequel revel offer immers univers rival depth complex acclaim fantasi seri the film intric world narr grandeur strongli suggest revisit predecessor although standalon prowess equal engag longstand fan newcom deni villeneuv directori geniu shine make compel case stewardship epic narr surpass prequel sequel boast mesmer score han zimmer alongsid unparallel technic masteri visual effect cinematographi set new benchmark the narr weav deeper charact arc introduc captiv new figur amidst jawdrop action leav last impress thi film conclud journey begun earlier also skill lay groundwork futur explor saga anticip sequel dune messiah high hope elev genr upcom award season challeng prevail bias fantasyscifi narr an imax view recommend fulli appreci cinemat masterpiec poi becom genredefin classic thi sequel come highli recommend promis unforgett cinemat experi

"Just saw this in IMAX. Wow, what a well done movie, a terrific rendition of the second half of the book ""Dune"".

In many ways, the movie is an improvement on the book, making Chani's character a more realistic version of the tough fighter that she was instead of the pliable obedient 1960s era woman in the book. None of that ""history will remember us as wives"" ending.

The progression of Paul's gradual acceptance of the mantle of the Lisan al-Gaib is also fleshed out better.

Austin Butler stands out in his role as the psychotic Feyd Rautha. The portrayal of the world of Giedi Prime in black and white was terrific.

The sandworms and the sand trout and their connection to the Water of Life were all well done.

Some have criticized Stilgar's transformation from a tough tribal leader into a True Believer, but that was his character arc in the book. Javier Bardem showed this progression well.

The Great Houses refusing to accept Paul's rule at the end, thus triggering a devastating holy war, was another logical change from the book. I had always wondered why the jihad in the book still started when the Great Houses had accepted Paul as Emperor already.

A great movie, destined to be remembered as one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.",just saw imax wow well done movi terrif rendit second half book dune in mani way movi improv book make chani charact realist version tough fighter instead pliabl obedi era woman book none histori rememb u wive end the progress paul gradual accept mantl lisan algaib also flesh better austin butler stand role psychot feyd rautha the portray world giedi prime black white terrif the sandworm sand trout connect water life well done some critic stilgar transform tough tribal leader true believ charact arc book javier bardem show progress well the great hous refus accept paul rule end thu trigger devast holi war anoth logic chang book i alway wonder jihad book still start great hous accept paul emperor alreadi a great movi destin rememb one best scifi movi time
"When I watched the first part some time ago, I wasn't very impressed. The film was very slow and the excitement didn't start until the last 15 minutes. This film, on the other hand, was thrilling from start to finish. There were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time. The fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement.

Also, I can't say that the film was too abrupt. There was love, depression and compassion very cleverly woven in. The film offered the whole spectrum of emotions.

Speaking of the actors, Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides did an excellent job, offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power. One could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase 'power corrupts'. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was also excellent. The inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincing.

Visually, the film was extremely well made. Combined with the music by Hanz Zimmer, the visuals were so evocative that in some moments I found myself shivering.

"I missed seeing this one in theatres. I don't feel so bad about it now, as incredible as the visuals were and some of the action scenes were, its just not able to be a great film.

And im so grateful sci fi epics like this get made, that look stunning and are epic and scope.

Most unforgiveably, the jump in narrative and storyline cuts to a completely different scene, it is confusing and lends a lack of resolution to the film.

Zendaya is wrongly cast here. Her acting is... okay but she doesnt not suit the look of the film. We all know why she was chosen in this role. She actually looks like a boy in many scenes, she was passable in Spidey but not here. Chalamet and Bautista are poor and seem to have clocked it in. Even the setting, of continuous dunes of sand gets a bit... bland.

Theres a great story here, just not a great film.",i miss see one theatr i dont feel bad incred visual action scene abl great film and im grate sci fi epic like get made look stun epic scope most unforgiv jump narr storylin cut complet differ scene confus lend lack resolut film zendaya wrongli cast her act okay doesnt suit look film we know chosen role she actual look like boy mani scene passabl spidey chalamet bautista poor seem clock even set continu dune sand get bit bland there great stori great film
"First off, Dune Part Two does justice to Frank Herbert's visions when he authored the book. The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.

Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.

Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timothée Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.

I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.

Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.

This movie had some unintentional comedic moments. The Fremen's reaction to anything that Paul did made my near-entire theater laugh three times.

Already, this review is getting very long, but props to Hans Zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a movie.

"Very bad acting by Timothee and Zendaya , literally worst actors ever. The dialogue is sophomorish and low IQ. The plot is predictable. The script is just lame boring and crap..The acting is woody .. the costumes don't even look better than the costumes in the original 1980s Dune movie. The original Dune movie is 10x better than this overrated movie. This movie has so many flat boring scenes..if not for the over dramatic sound and sound effects I would have fallen asleep already. Did I say the acting is really bad? Seriously the original Dune movie is 10x better and more original.

"""Dune Part Two"" is not just a film; it's an immersive journey that envelops you in its vast, mesmerizing universe. As a fan of the first installment, I eagerly anticipated this sequel, and it exceeded all expectations. Denis Villeneuve's direction brings Frank Herbert's world to life with such depth and authenticity that you feel transported to the sands of Arrakis yourself. What struck me most was the perfect balance of CGI usage. While the film relies heavily on visual effects to portray its otherworldly landscapes and creatures, it never feels overdone or artificial. Instead, the CGI enhances the storytelling, seamlessly blending with practical effects to create a believable and awe-inspiring world. From the towering sandworms to the intricate architecture of the Fremen sietches, every detail feels meticulously crafted, drawing you further into the narrative. It's a testament to the filmmakers' skill that even in the most visually stunning sequences, the focus remains on the characters and their emotional journey. As I watched ""Dune Part Two,"" I found myself completely immersed in its world, captivated by its beauty and complexity. It's a rare feat for a film to strike such a perfect balance between spectacle and substance, and for that, it deserves all the praise it receives. In my eyes, ""Dune Part Two"" is not just a sequel; it's a cinematic masterpiece.",dune part two film immers journey envelop vast mesmer univers a fan first instal i eagerli anticip sequel exceed expect deni villeneuv direct bring frank herbert world life depth authent feel transport sand arraki what struck perfect balanc cgi usag while film reli heavili visual effect portray otherworldli landscap creatur never feel overdon artifici instead cgi enhanc storytel seamlessli blend practic effect creat believ aweinspir world from tower sandworm intric architectur fremen sietch everi detail feel meticul craft draw narr it testament filmmak skill even visual stun sequenc focu remain charact emot journey a i watch dune part two i found complet immers world captiv beauti complex it rare feat film strike perfect balanc spectacl substanc deserv prais receiv in eye dune part two sequel cinemat masterpiec
"What happens when you give an expert filmmaker like Denis Villeneuve a massive movie budget and a massive amount of talent to work with? You get a massive, powerful movie. I left the theater thinking, ""I just saw the movie of the year.""

I was aware of the hype going in, but did not expect to personally give Dune: Part 2 a 10/10, but it reminded me of the full potential of cinema. There are many movies that entertain me, but this one was more than simple entertainment... it was an experience. It's not often a movie gives me goosebumps, and I got them multiple times throughout this movie.

I thought to myself while watching, ""This is what top-notch movie making looks like."" I also thought, ""This has got to be the most expensive movie ever made."" It's visually out of this world. In a time where streaming movies at home is the most popular way to see a movie, Dune: Part 2 is another reminder of just how special seeing a movie in theater can be. The cinematography and sound alone make this a movie that must be seen in the biggest theater possible.

It's hard to believe without seeing it, but Dune: Part 2 will be counted among the best sequels ever made, best sci-fi films ever made, best literature adaptations ever made, and perhaps best films overall ever made.",what happen give expert filmmak like deni villeneuv massiv movi budget massiv amount talent work you get massiv power movi i left theater think i saw movi year i awar hype go expect person give dune part remind full potenti cinema there mani movi entertain one simpl entertain experi it often movi give goosebump i got multipl time throughout movi i thought watch thi topnotch movi make look like i also thought thi got expens movi ever made it visual world in time stream movi home popular way see movi dune part anoth remind special see movi theater the cinematographi sound alon make movi must seen biggest theater possibl it hard believ without see dune part count among best sequel ever made best scifi film ever made best literatur adapt ever made perhap best film overal ever made

"I find myself perplexed by the casting choices in this film, particularly the inclusion of Christoffer Walken and Anna Taylor-Joy, among others. Their presence in the movie felt incongruous to me and significantly impacted my viewing experience. This sentiment echoes some of the other critiques I've come across, where it was suggested that selecting individuals at random from a shopping mall might have yielded a more suitable cast. Moreover, the pacing of the film left something to be desired, as it could have been improved to enhance the overall narrative flow. Despite these criticisms, it's important to note that I did appreciate the movie overall. The storyline, cinematography, and other aspects were engaging, but the casting and pacing issues detracted from my full enjoyment and immersion in the film.",i find perplex cast choic film particularli inclus christoff walken anna taylorjoy among other their presenc movi felt incongru significantli impact view experi thi sentiment echo critiqu ive come across suggest select individu random shop mall might yield suitabl cast moreov pace film left someth desir could improv enhanc overal narr flow despit critic import note i appreci movi overal the storylin cinematographi aspect engag cast pace issu detract full enjoy immers film
"Well where do I even begin. Review done by @RatedFairly on x.

Denis Villeneuve congratulations. This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It's definetly in my top 15. Maybe top 10 or higher movies of all time. So let's break down why

Music: Hans Zimmer. Greatest of all time. The music that is portrayed through the film is just perfection. It's fantastic. It's tasty. It's impressive and it's filled with emotions. Every scene tells a tale and a story but with the music it becomes dreamy. Absolutely fantastic to see and feel and hear.

Writing: This movie actually follows the books. I haven't personally read the books but many of my close friends has and they all say they are very pleased. From a neutral point of view, the lines, the way the movie and character was shown was fantastic. How certain words and lines, like Javier Bardem put out can fill your head with a much larger picture, is exactly what this movie needs. So well ""world building"". I am just deeply impressed. It wasn't too much comedy or jokes, but the perfect amount that got everyone in the cinema laughing, to people in the cinema crying and being impressed by the scenery.

Visuals: Breathtaking. Fantastic. I don't have enough words. Some of the CGI (like 2 or 3 small parts) I found a bit odd but that's just movies for you. The visuals were fantastic. Denis is right. Some scenes you don't need words or lines to portray emotion or set the scene. Music and certain visuals will do it for you. Scary, Epic, Insane, Love. Everything was perfect. I am deeply impressed. Only movie recently with better visuals was Avatar 2 and that says A LOT!!!

Characters: I don't want to make this way to long but wow. Timothy killed it. Javier killed it. Austin killed it. Zendaya killed it. Every actor killed it. Stellan was just PERFECT AGAIN!!! Scary as a ...... just fantastic man. So well done. Acting was perfect. Switching between emotions. I have just no words. This movie was just fantastic.

Like I put on x, I rate this movie 8.8 out of time. Which is a high for me. I have very few films above 9 but this was one of those that was really close.",well i even begin review done ratedfairli x deni villeneuv congratul thi one best movi i ever watch it definetli top mayb top higher movi time so let break music han zimmer greatest time the music portray film perfect it fantast it tasti it impress fill emot everi scene tell tale stori music becom dreami absolut fantast see feel hear write thi movi actual follow book i havent person read book mani close friend say plea from neutral point view line way movi charact shown fantast how certain word line like javier bardem put fill head much larger pictur exactli movi need so well world build i deepli impress it wasnt much comedi joke perfect amount got everyon cinema laugh peopl cinema cri impress sceneri visual breathtak fantast i dont enough word some cgi like small part i found bit odd that movi the visual fantast deni right some scene dont need word line portray emot set scene music certain visual scari epic insan love everyth perfect i deepli impress onli movi recent better visual avatar say a lot charact i dont want make way long wow timothi kill javier kill austin kill zendaya kill everi actor kill stellan perfect again scari fantast man so well done act perfect switch emot i word thi movi fantast like i put x i rate movi time which high i film one realli close
"This movie does not follow Mr Herbert's storyline. I have read his Dune books several times. Part one barely followed the story but Part Two does not follow more than 5% of it. To my thinking, the first volume should have been a 3-part set at the least. Or a 3 season series. The movies are a disservice to Mr Herbert. I could go into detail but I think it would be a waste of time and effort. The part of the story about Alia, Paul's sister needs to be fleshed out more so her story would show her importance. And the complete part of Princess Irulan should be told in total. And the story of Chani and subsequently the death of their first child needs to be told.",thi movi follow mr herbert storylin i read dune book sever time part one bare follow stori part two follow to think first volum part set least or season seri the movi disservic mr herbert i could go detail i think would wast time effort the part stori alia paul sister need flesh stori would show import and complet part princess irulan told total and stori chani subsequ death first child need told
"Dune: Part Two exemplifies cinematic brilliance.

With a masterful blend of storytelling, visuals, and sound, this film delivers an unforgettable experience. Denis Villeneuve's direction is nothing short of extraordinary, and the performances are top-notch. In an era where blockbusters often prioritize spectacle over substance, Dune: Part Two stands as a beacon of artistic integrity.

It's a film that dares to challenge, to provoke, and to inspire. So heed my advice: don't just see Dune: Part Two, experience it. Let its grandeur wash over you, and revel in the magic of cinema at its finest.

Whether you're a fan of the book or new to the universe, Dune: Part Two will captivate you from start to finish. And trust me, seeing it on the biggest screen possible, like IMAX, is an absolute must.

How often these days can you say a sequel surpasses the first film? Now I understand that this is technically a second part of one whole story however the depth and scale of this film is remarkable that deserves commendation to all involved who have pushed it beyond the first film in every way. It is truly a masterpiece - a film that will be talked about for generations and one that will undoubtedly become a classic of cinema. A book that many thought would be impossible to fully convey through film has finally had its triumph on the big screen thanks to the mastermind that is Denis Villenevue.,how often day say sequel surpass first film now i understand technic second part one whole stori howev depth scale film remark deserv commend involv push beyond first film everi way it truli masterpiec film talk gener one undoubtedli becom classic cinema a book mani thought would imposs fulli convey film final triumph big screen thank mastermind deni villenevu
"Dune 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to the spice flowing desert planet of Arrakis and more from the first shot, to the last. The world building feel so natural and intuitive. We get to spend a lot of silent and intimate moments in between moments with all the characters because of which the big moments feel like they were earned not given. The dialogues are simple regarding the religious themes and ideas of the Fremen culture so if you listen and follow carefully it will all make sense. Every single department of Dune 2 has given us, the cinema fans and the film industry ""a masterclass in filmmaking"".

"There aren't many films out there in which the follow up betters the first, but with DUNE Part 2 we have not only a winner but an epic masterpiece which doesn't disappoint even once. Everything works, amazing story, screenplay, script, cinematography, score, actors, the lot, Denis delivers when so many others have failed. The pace of the film was a major plus factor as well, at no point are we left questioning how we have got there, nothing was rushed unlike many other films that feel the need to overload the audience, which for me ruins a film. The only downside is we have to wait another 3 years for Part 3.",there arent mani film follow better first dune part winner epic masterpiec doesnt disappoint even everyth work amaz stori screenplay script cinematographi score actor lot deni deliv mani other fail the pace film major plu factor well point left question got noth rush unlik mani film feel need overload audienc ruin film the downsid wait anoth year part
"To avoid 'spoilers' for the third attempt at making a cinematic version of a book over 50 years old, all I can really say is that I'm tired of movies that are adaptions in name only.

The timeline is screwed, making character development and motivations screwed, all to create a false drama at the end. Drama which actually makes a part 3 quite difficult to get off the ground.

Quite disappointed in this attempt, given the huge budget available. The vision, design, and direction are all lacking, the portrayals are inconsistent and strange and often flat, in spite of the fact many of the performers have done well in other projects.

Sad, we now have to wait another dew decades to see if someone tries again. I'm going to stick to the 1984 or 2000 versions. Changes in those were easily explained by budget and limitations in the era in which they were made, this movie has no such excuse.",to avoid spoiler third attempt make cinemat version book year old i realli say im tire movi adapt name the timelin screw make charact develop motiv screw creat fals drama end drama actual make part quit difficult get ground quit disappoint attempt given huge budget avail the vision design direct lack portray inconsist strang often flat spite fact mani perform done well project sad wait anoth dew decad see someon tri im go stick version chang easili explain budget limit era made movi excus
"""Dune: Part 2"" is an absolute masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Denis Villeneuve's visionary direction coupled with Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing score creates an unparalleled cinematic experience. The music alone is enough to transport you to the hauntingly beautiful world of Arrakis, but combined with stunning visuals and a compelling narrative, it elevates the film to greatness.

One of the standout aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its lingering kind of vibe, which immerses the audience into the rich tapestry of the Dune universe. From the vast deserts to the intricate politics, every detail is meticulously crafted, making the world feel both expansive and lived-in. This attention to detail extends to the characters as well, each of whom is brought to life with depth and complexity.

Story-wise, ""Dune: Part 2"" is driven and never feels out of touch. The film maintains a calm pace, allowing the tension to simmer and build gradually. Every scene feels purposeful, leading to a climactic conclusion that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Villeneuve masterfully balances exposition with action, ensuring that the audience is always engaged.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its ability to convey a sense of scale. From the towering sandworms to the sprawling cities, everything feels epic in scope. Yet, amidst the grandeur, there is also an intimacy to the story, as it explores themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.

The performances in ""Dune: Part 2"" are nothing short of stellar. Timothée Chalamet shines as the conflicted hero, Paul Atreides, bringing both vulnerability and strength to the role. Rebecca Ferguson is equally compelling as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, while Oscar Isaac delivers a commanding performance as Duke Leto Atreides. The supporting cast, including Zendaya, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem, also deliver standout performances, adding depth and texture to the film.

Overall, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a triumph of filmmaking. It's rare to find a movie that excels on so many levels, but Villeneuve has managed to create a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. Whether you're a fan of science fiction or simply appreciate great storytelling, ""Dune: Part 2"" is not to be missed.",dune part absolut masterpiec captiv start finish deni villeneuv visionari direct coupl han zimmer mesmer score creat unparallel cinemat experi the music alon enough transport hauntingli beauti world arraki combin stun visual compel narr elev film great one standout aspect dune part linger kind vibe immers audienc rich tapestri dune univers from vast desert intric polit everi detail meticul craft make world feel expans livedin thi attent detail extend charact well brought life depth complex storywis dune part driven never feel touch the film maintain calm pace allow tension simmer build gradual everi scene feel purpos lead climact conclus leav edg seat villeneuv master balanc exposit action ensur audienc alway engag one impress aspect dune part abil convey sen scale from tower sandworm sprawl citi everyth feel epic scope yet amidst grandeur also intimaci stori explor theme power destini human condit the perform dune part noth short stellar timoth chalamet shine conflict hero paul atreid bring vulner strength role rebecca ferguson equal compel paul mother ladi jessica oscar isaac deliv command perform duke leto atreid the support cast includ zendaya jason momoa javier bardem also deliv standout perform ad depth textur film overal dune part triumph filmmak it rare find movi excel mani level villeneuv manag creat cinemat masterpiec rememb year come whether your fan scienc fiction simpli appreci great storytel dune part miss
"It is rare for a film to meet the monumental expectations that the world has cast upon Dune Pt. 2. This film shatters all of them. In his return to Arrakis, director Denis Villeneuve flexes every directorial muscle we've come to expect from him and then some. Dune Part 2 is an instant classic, the best science fiction film produced this century, and proof that in the cinema, imagery and sound remain king. Fans of the book and newcomers to the world of Dune will be in awe of the secrets that lay waiting for them in the desert of Arrakis.

"This film has potential to be one the greatest movies of all time. Words can hardly describe what this movie made me feel. With every big fight scene, you can feel everything. The loud pounding of gunshots, the heavy clanking of swords and knifes smashing against one another. And with the small, hand-to-hand fights, you can feel the emotion, every punch, kick, stab, all of it. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, unlike any I've ever seen before.

Timothée Chalamet deserve all the praise he is about to gain from this film. This has to be Chalamet's best performance yet, along with many others. While not his best performance, Austin Butler absolutely delivers in this movie as Feyd Rautha. Not quite living up to antagonist performances such as Heath Ledger's Joker in Nolan's Dark Knight or co-star Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men. However he is absolutely on the new list of film antagonist. Amongst others such as Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya, this movie is packed with the greatest performances I've witnessed in a sci-fi film.

Greig Fraser, oh Lord where do I even begin. This film's cinematography was absolutely stupendous! I'd put this movie's cinematography on par with such works like Linus Sandgren in La La Land and Roger Deakins in 1917, this movie has the masterful blend of color, angles, and framing. Everything about this movies cinematography set the tones perfectly and I'm one hundred percent here for it.

"If you are reading this, you probably already heard a thousand times that the movie is visually stunning, and while i agree (that's why I am giving it 7 stars, despite all the criticism below), it puts visuals above everything else, killing logic and storytelling in the process.

The stark, sometimes almost monochrome visual style, is very much contemporary, and I dare to say that it will not age well. At least I hope so, because it will mean that people will rediscover colors.

Everything has to be black, white and one additional color. This means everything on Dune consists of bare stone walls an sand. People are living this way? No furniture, no textiles, no food. Sand and stone. No life!

Everything has to be black, even the good guys. Even the Fremen stillsuits are black, which is the worst possible color to pick for a suit that is supposed to help you survive in the desert.

The lifelessness does not stop there - even the emperor of the galaxy is a bland lifeless colorless type, that looks like he just stepped out of a retirement home (maybe that's some kind of intented political message?)

My second biggest gripe is also a very contemporary problem - Paul, the ubermensch messiah, can't do a single action scene without looking for his girl to support, because the message that she is as strong as him, powerful, independent, etc etc, of course has to be driven home, as is customary today. They even sacrifice the original plot (where she is a mother), in order to have her be a kick ass fighter, because we surely don't get enough female fighters in nowaday's cinema.

All in all, I liked the books ok, but let's face it: Dune did not age well as a story. It's too complex to be popcorn SciFi like Star Wars, and too illogical to be taken seriously. Nothing in the story makes sense, the whole setup is completely ridiculous. Unlike Star Wars, it also completely fails to make the universe feel big, filled with life. Even the major houses feel like a joke - we get these battles between the supposedly most powerful players in the galaxy, and it's like a hundred dudes killing each other with knives.

In my opinion, the only one who could have ever really made a good movie out of Dune was Jodorowky. At least that would have been psychedelic, which is another aspect this movie is completely lacking. The main point of the movie is a drug that lets you bend spacetime and see the future, and we do not get a single psychedelic shot in 6 hours?

"I actually enjoyed Part I more than this. One hour in, I had to check the time. There's only so much time that can be spent on explaining that Charlamee is the savior.

The bright spot was definitely Javier Bardem, great performance for an otherwise banal cast of actors. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were outstanding, and the story had its moments, but overall it was frankly boring.

This was a big disappointment because it got off to a really good start and in the first hour, the editing and immersion was on point. But once they entered Austin Butler's character, it fell apart.

Cringeworthy character development and cliched storytelling at its finest, but I'm sure younger people and newbie sci-fi fans will love it. This is no masterpiece, not even close. Part I was actually better overall.

"Dune Part 2 delivers a sandstorm of epic proportions, continuing the journey of Paul Atreides in a visually stunning and thrilling sequel. The desert landscapes are breathtaking, the sandworms are terrifyingly majestic and unlike other recent blockbusters, humour is subtly woven into the narrative.

Although there were the necessary details book omitted, from the process of crafting something from a page onto a screen, it didn't feel like it was missing any character depth, especially from the key players.

As the Bene Gesserit saying goes, ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer."" and Director Denis Villeneuve wasn't afraid of taking on this second half of this story. He masterfully crafts a world that is both familiar and alien, drawing viewers deeper into the intricate web of politics, power and prophecy. Dune Part 2 is a mesmerizing cinematic experience that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next instalment.",dune part deliv sandstorm epic proport continu journey paul atreid visual stun thrill sequel the desert landscap breathtak sandworm terrifyingli majest unlik recent blockbust humour subtli woven narr although necessari detail book omit process craft someth page onto screen didnt feel like miss charact depth especi key player a bene gesserit say goe i must fear fear mindkil director deni villeneuv wasnt afraid take second half stori he master craft world familiar alien draw viewer deeper intric web polit power propheci dune part mesmer cinemat experi leav eagerli anticip next instal

"Do yourselves a favour and go see it now. I was so enthralled by the first part that as soon as I stepped out of the theater, I ordered the original 6 books. I was so surprised to find that it was not an ordinary sci-fi novel, but that it was a beautiful blend of religion, philosophy, politics and history. Part two does justice to the first book and the adaptations, such as Alia not being born yet, didn't bother me at all. I understand it would have been an impossible task to find a child actor for the part. The cinematography and the music were, again, simply outstanding. As was Timothee Chalamet. The speech he gave in front of the fremen leaders gave me the goosebumps.

"I rarely ever write reviews but I felt I had to after watching this film.

I'm a massive fan of the first film (probably my favorite behind Into the spider-verse and maybe Interstellar) and Denis is by far my favorite director, so my expectations were basically in Earth's orbit and it still managed to surpass them.

I have never read the 1965 book as I wanted to wait for this film before i read it, so I had no idea what i was in store for but I loved it and this was probably the best cinema experience I've ever had, especially since i got to watch it a day early in the biggest screen at the cinema I work at all by myself.

"I was super hyped to watch the movie, there are very few if any films with this high a rating. I don't get it. Why is this bit now in black and white. I really struggled to watch it . Literally nothing happens. There's a gladiator remade scene which was odd. It's a bit of a mish mash of stuff while slick and fantastically well made, it's a bit boring. I don't care about the characters. The guy from guardians of the galaxy basically plays the same comic role which I don't know if this wasn't intentional humour but the best bit in a very serious movie.

Christopher Walken looks like he's going to say where am I any moment, sort of looks a bit lost.

Overall stunning visuals, truly epic, but for 3 hours very little happens and the mix of styles is a bit confusing. The characters are a bit sterile and the story takes too long to unfold.",i super hype watch movi film high rate i dont get whi bit black white i realli struggl watch liter noth happen there gladiat remad scene odd it bit mish mash stuff slick fantast well made bit bore i dont care charact the guy guardian galaxi basic play comic role i dont know wasnt intent humour best bit seriou movi christoph walken look like he go say i moment sort look bit lost overal stun visual truli epic hour littl happen mix style bit confus the charact bit steril stori take long unfold

You really see him grow into this character the Lisan Al-Gaib. There were a few acting performances that did not hit par but on the whole, this is a mega movie and a true box-office beast.

"""Dune: Part Two,"" despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga, falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor, leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development. Where Denis Villeneuve's first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of Frank Herbert's iconic series, this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum, veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectacle.

The film's pacing is one of its most glaring issues. It oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens. This erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the story's emotional weight, leaving the audience disengaged from what should be high-stakes moments.

Character development, or the lack thereof, further detracts from the film's appeal. Newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond one-dimensional figures. This oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define Herbert's characters. Even returning characters, who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity, are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelines.

Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design. However, these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings. The reliance on CGI spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novel's themes of power, ecology, and human nature.

Moreover, the script seems to struggle with balancing the source material's dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences. As a result, much of the film's potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation, replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first film.

In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the Dune saga. Its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial. While die-hard fans may find moments to enjoy, those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more. This sequel, unfortunately, suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal, the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place.",dune part two despit ambiti attempt continu epic saga fall significantli short expect set predecessor leav much desir narr depth charact develop where deni villeneuv first instal offer visual stun philosoph rich entranc univers frank herbert icon seri sequel struggl maintain momentum veer realm cinemat redund superfici spectacl the film pace one glare issu it oscil rush sequenc skim crucial plot point tediou stretch littl consequ happen thi errat tempo disrupt narr flow also undermin stori emot weight leav audienc disengag highstak moment charact develop lack thereof detract film appeal newcom cast introduc great fanfar given scant screen time evolv beyond onedimension figur thi oversight particularli disappoint given rich backstori intric person defin herbert charact even return charact previous portray depth complex reduc mere shadow former selv often act charact push sidelin visual dune part two continu impress breathtak landscap meticul attent detail costum product design howev aesthet achiev cannot compens film narr shortcom the relianc cgi spectacl substant storytel feel like miss opportun explor novel theme power ecolog human natur moreov script seem struggl balanc sourc materi den polit intrigu need blockbust action sequenc a result much film potenti thought commentari imperi environment lost translat replac gener battl scene lack emot reson seen first film in conclus dune part two visual captiv ultim unsatisfi continu dune saga it failur capit groundwork laid predecessor result sequel feel overload superfici while diehard fan may find moment enjoy seek depth nuanc origin like left want thi sequel unfortun suggest attempt broaden appeal franchis sacrif element made distinct compel first place

At the same time, there are many details and happenings left behind, so for people who have not read the books it's a bit difficult to follow the narrative. The movie doesn't follow thoroughly the destiny of the other of the closest friends and servents of the Duke, who survived the massacre in part 1.",awesom stun the film follow spirit book everpres intern turmoil paul it feel mystic book the cinematographi spectacular han zimmer music the freeman harkon depict realli well planet dune at time mani detail happen left behind peopl read book bit difficult follow narr the movi doesnt follow thoroughli destini closest friend servent duke surviv massacr part

I will not exaggerate when I say that for me it is a masterpiece that I want to see again and again and again. So the director departed from the canon, the life of the Freemen is not revealed as in the book, but it is Herbert. In my opinion, Villeneuve did everything he could and did it beautifully. As for my favorite actors, Butler is the best for me, to portray Faith Rauta like that, I have gold in my limbs from his cruelty and charisma, it's incredible. The audio work is colossal.

"""Dune: Part Two"" is the much-anticipated sequel to the 2021 film ""Dune,"" both based on the seminal science fiction novel by Frank Herbert. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film continues the story of Paul Atreides as he navigates the treacherous politics and conflicts of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. With stunning visuals, a compelling narrative, and a stellar cast, ""Dune: Part Two"" promises to be an immersive cinematic experience that delves deeper into the richly imagined universe of the source material.

Set in a distant future where humanity has spread across the galaxy and formed a feudal society, ""Dune: Part Two"" explores themes of politics, religion, ecology, and the human condition. At the center of the story is Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, a young nobleman whose family assumes control of Arrakis, the only known source of the valuable spice melange. The spice is essential for space travel, making it the most valuable substance in the universe and the focus of intense political intrigue.

In ""Dune: Part One,"" we saw Paul's family, House Atreides, betrayed by their rivals, House Harkonnen, leading to their downfall and Paul's journey into the desert, where he discovers his destiny as a prophesied messiah figure, the Kwisatz Haderach. The film ended with Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), joining forces with the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen, as they prepare to take back control of the planet.

""Dune: Part Two"" picks up where the first film left off, with Paul and the Fremen launching a guerilla war against the Harkonnens and their imperial allies, the corrupt Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. As Paul embraces his role as the Kwisatz Haderach and gains the trust of the Fremen, he must also contend with the visions of the future that come with his newfound powers. These visions, which are both a blessing and a curse, show him possible futures where he becomes a savior or a tyrant, leading to internal conflict as he struggles to determine the right path.

One of the central themes of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the idea of destiny versus free will. Paul's journey is guided by prophecies and ancient traditions, but he also has the ability to shape his own fate. This internal conflict is reflected in the larger political struggle for control of Arrakis, as various factions vie for power and influence, each believing they are following the path laid out for them by fate.

The film also delves deeper into the ecology of Arrakis and the role of the spice melange in shaping the planet's ecosystem. The spice is produced by giant sandworms that inhabit the deserts of Arrakis, and its extraction has had a profound impact on the planet's environment. The Fremen, who have adapted to life in the harsh desert, have a deep respect for the planet and its fragile ecosystem, seeing themselves as stewards rather than exploiters.

Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning landscapes, intricate costumes, and cutting-edge special effects bringing Herbert's vision of Arrakis to life. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, adds to the epic feel of the story, with sweeping orchestral themes that underscore the drama and emotion of the narrative.

In addition to Chalamet and Ferguson, ""Dune: Part Two"" features a talented ensemble cast, including Zendaya as Chani, a Fremen warrior and Paul's love interest; Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father; and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen tribe that takes Paul in. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their role, helping to flesh out the complex characters that inhabit Herbert's universe.

Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a worthy continuation of the story begun in the first film, expanding upon the themes and ideas introduced in ""Dune"" while setting the stage for an epic conclusion. With its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and talented cast, the film is sure to captivate audiences and further cement Villeneuve's reputation as one of the premier directors working in science fiction today.",dune part two muchanticip sequel film dune base semin scienc fiction novel frank herbert direct deni villeneuv film continu stori paul atreid navig treacher polit conflict desert planet arraki also known dune with stun visual compel narr stellar cast dune part two promis immers cinemat experi delv deeper richli imagin univers sourc materi set distant futur human spread across galaxi form feudal societi dune part two explor theme polit religion ecolog human condit at center stori paul atreid play timoth chalamet young nobleman whose famili assum control arraki known sourc valuabl spice melang the spice essenti space travel make valuabl substanc univers focu intens polit intrigu in dune part one saw paul famili hous atreid betray rival hous harkonnen lead downfal paul journey desert discov destini prophesi messiah figur kwisatz haderach the film end paul mother ladi jessica rebecca ferguson join forc nativ peopl arraki fremen prepar take back control planet dune part two pick first film left paul fremen launch guerilla war harkonnen imperi alli corrupt padishah emperor shaddam iv a paul embrac role kwisatz haderach gain trust fremen must also contend vision futur come newfound power these vision bless cur show possibl futur becom savior tyrant lead intern conflict struggl determin right path one central theme dune part two idea destini versu free paul journey guid propheci ancient tradit also abil shape fate thi intern conflict reflect larger polit struggl control arraki variou faction vie power influenc believ follow path laid fate the film also delv deeper ecolog arraki role spice melang shape planet ecosystem the spice produc giant sandworm inhabit desert arraki extract profound impact planet environ the fremen adapt life harsh desert deep respect planet fragil ecosystem see steward rather exploit visual dune part two feast eye stun landscap intric costum cuttingedg special effect bring herbert vision arraki life the film score compos han zimmer add epic feel stori sweep orchestr theme underscor drama emot narr in addit chalamet ferguson dune part two featur talent ensembl cast includ zendaya chani fremen warrior paul love interest oscar isaac duke leto atreid paul father javier bardem stilgar leader fremen tribe take paul each actor bring depth nuanc role help flesh complex charact inhabit herbert univers overal dune part two worthi continu stori begun first film expand upon theme idea introduc dune set stage epic conclus with compel narr stun visual talent cast film sure captiv audienc cement villeneuv reput one premier director work scienc fiction today
"Dune: Part 2 is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first movie was also good, but I gave it an 8. I give this movie a 10. Timothée Chalamet's acting reaches its peak with this movie. The performances of the other actors were also good, but one of them captivated me. I would even put Rebecca Ferguson's performance ahead of Timothée Chalamet. She was simply mesmerizing. There's not much more to say. Because everything is obvious. It's a perfect movie. Towards the end of the movie, my smart wristband gave me a pulse alert. Because the music of the movie affected me a lot. I think it is very lucky for the Oscar nominees that the movie was not released in 2023, otherwise Oppenheimer and the other nominees would have no chance against Dune. I can already say that Dune will win all the awards at the Oscars in 2025.

Denis Villeneuve has combined an almost flawless story with ingenious and unique cinematography and breathtaking scenery and this movie came out of it.

Combined with Hans Zimmer's music, which makes you feel like you're on another planet even without the movie, this film creates a perfect and almost unique atmosphere.

Really ruined the experience for me. There are just so many scenes of people looking out over sand dunes and blowing sand that one can stand.

"The first one was nearly perfect, a 9/10 movie, was hooked from the first till the last scene, but what is this? The pacing, the jumps in story/time, the first hour of the movie is absolutely poinless and could have been done in 20 minutes, not 1 hr. Gives no explanation to whats going on, just pushes characters in and out of the story/situation when needed.

The CGI wide shots we great, Harkonens were the best part but were on screen a small amount.

Feyd-Rautha was absouletly the peak of the film and he is also basically meaningless and just breazes trough the movie without any significant impact. The final battle carries little emotional impact.

After a magnificent Dune 1 we got this sub-par bore of a movie and it is absolutely scary to see just how peoples standards for good movies/art have fallen. People glorify this as a masterpiece, when it is far from it. Decades of sub par art will do that.

"Dune part 2 is a masterclass in filmmaking, skilfully directed by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings Frank Herbert's complex universe to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.

The cinematography is a visual feast, with sweeping desert landscapes and awe-inspiring set pieces that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by stellar performances from Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.

Furthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the entire experience, perfectly complementing the grandeur of the narrative.

Battles in the sand are looking super cool in cinema. This entire movie will loose a lot in home tv without good sound and big screen so I recommend not to wait and run to cinema now.

Plot itself is well executed. They didnt portrayed it in black-white fashion with good Paul and evil emperor. Paul can be seen as changing gaining self-confidence and power but loosing his human side. Which is great. Perfect characters are for marvel. Here we have evil(or not?) emperor who keep galaxy peaceful but do a lot of dirty deeds to keep it in good shape.

And on the other side our hero who will bring war and destruction to entire universe. But he is a good guy for us - because he looks well and we follow him for two movie as the main protagonist.

"Dune Part Two It has come to full fruition. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series might be the greatest sci-fi series in cinematic history. The new age of cinema has shown its potential to not just adapt in filmmaking but to show a great storyline and potentially become a classic in centuries to come. And I believe that with all of my heart. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series will be the sci-fi film that will share the throne as the greatest amongst the classics.

It's a wild thing to say for a latest-release film, and I do understand the recency bias phenomenon among moviegoers. But I also believe Denis Dune will grow on people from time to time, as I felt that myself with Dune Part One rewatches and also my observation on the audiences latest reviews on Dune Part One rewatch.

There are two eyewitnesses to this film: the novel non-readers and the readers. It is a bipartite review as to how they perceived this film, and I can say that I'm jealous of how non-readers might perceive this film. While I might see the words becoming a full visualization, I'm also trying to perceive how non-readers see its story.

From this statement, it's due to how there are quite plenty of omissions and changes in the storyline from the novel, and the way I'm wording it doesn't indicate a bad thing, but it's a ""huh"" moment for me as I immersed myself in the story with a new perception. I believe most non-readers will see it as a linear, perfect storyline, but it's different for me, and this is not entirely a bad thing.

To sum up the statement, Denis and Jon have done a tremendous job on the storyline and screenwriting, and I have to say it's the best decision yet to make the storyline go in the other direction. Most of the new scenes leave me in a great shock at how well told it is and how unexpectedly it turned out to be played, especially the ending.

The words for this storyline are more fierce and cruel.

Dune Part Two is an experience, not just a film of fiction. It is dramatic in its depth, poignant in its love story, profound and cruel in its motive, and epic in its style that's grandeur and maximized to near perfection.

I'm blown away by how Denis managed to achieve this level of mastery in an adaptation of the greatest sci-fi novel in history. Dune Part Two is a masterpiece and beautifully adapted.

It just gets better.

Moving away from the main thematic entrance to this cinematic desert masterpiece. I just have to talk about the ingredients that make this film as spicy as it gets.

The cinematography is top-notch and one of the most remarkable aspects of this film. The film was a whole 2 hours and 40 minutes of eye-catching experience to be immersed on a big screen. This film managed to capture lots of moments in this scene that'll make you go, ""Hell yeah, that's fire.""

The color grading for this film has its way to be most deliberate and non-subtle but will make you feel the atmospheric changes in the film, capturing the moment so well with how it is done. You'll know what I mean here...

All this couldn't be done without the creative mind of Greg Frasier and perfect visualizations by Denis Villeneuve. Reading the texts and seeing how it's done in the film is one of the blessings I felt in my cinematic experience.

Hans Zimmer is truly a work of art. His craft manages to consistently elevate one after the other in his film scores. The Dune Part Two soundtrack is perfectly conveyed with the instruments played and will put you in every emotion to be felt in this film.

I believe Timothée Chalamet has outdone himself in this film. There are many doubts lingering about this young actor, but this film will definitely solidify them. The acting was fierce and potent enough to grip you to the edge of your seat, and I'm going to tell you to prepare for what's to come.

It has always been a topic of him being overrated, but hopefully Dune Part Two will prove doubters wrong and how talented Timothée actually is. One of the greatest young actors in this new era of cinema, with a wide range of acting.

Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is exceptional casting that is once again unexpected. Like Timothée said in an interview, he has to prove himself for this film, and now it's Austin's turn, and he's actually done it. It is not an exaggeration when the word psychotic is thrown around. He truly is...

Dare I say it? Feyd-Rautha is way more psychotic and villainous than he is in the novel, and you just have to witness it.

I have every word to say about each actor and actress, but I couldn't prolong it. Timothée and Austin are prime examples of how well-acted this film is, and you guys have to witness others acting masterfully on the big screen.

My honorable mention before ending this review is how perfectly they created the Chakobsa language.

David Peterson and Denis managed to give this language depth with how dramatic the language sounds when it's spoken. It doesn't feel made up for the sake of being an incomprehensible language, but rather realistic and felt.

Dune Part Two is definitely worth a watch as it's healing sci-fi and action cinema right now, and I think everyone deserves to experience this in their lifetime.

"Usually when you watch something like this, you can't help that small part of you that wants to be a critic. You think, the book was better, or I don't like how they adapted that. Not with this movie, it's strong, powerful, every scene stands on its own, has purpose and expands the story. Character introduction is strong, acting amazing and powerful, the music score almost makes you want to cry, sound effects amazing and the graphics are just next level.

If you love a good story, even if you don't love sci-fi, you are probably going to love this movie. And if you are a sci-fi lover, this is the movie you have been waiting for.

I know that I liked this film more than part 1; however, it has enticed me to go back and watch the first again. That is what a good movie should do. If you go watch this film, please take special consideration of Paul. His character develops so amazingly. It is especially present at the end of the film.

"Dune Part Two, or, ""They fly now?"" ""They fly now.""

Well, that was... less than compelling. I liked Part One enough to watch it twice. By the end of this one I was so sick of light brown I was craving a blueberry. I have a lot more to say about it than I want to put here now (little of it good) but I'll try to keep it short.

Lots of miscasting IMO. Zendaya spends most of the film glaring and looking over her shoulder. Seriously. Her flat midwestern accent was terrifically out of place in the midst of all the other Fremen. Austin Butler looks down and to the side, like he does in every other performance (I just saw him doing nothing but in The Dead Don't Die.) Christopher Walken was a great dramatic actor but I can only see him as a joke now.

Fine visual effects, but far too long getting to them. Lots of people just... looking. I thought maybe Spielberg directed it for a while. This movie really made me hate sand. (It's coarse, and rough, and gets everywhere...)

I don't know if the book ended there but the movie ending seemed rather abrupt.",dune part two they fli they fli well less compel i like part one enough watch twice by end one i sick light brown i crave blueberri i lot say i want put littl good ill tri keep short lot miscast imo zendaya spend film glare look shoulder serious her flat midwestern accent terrif place midst fremen austin butler look side like everi perform i saw noth the dead dont die christoph walken great dramat actor i see joke fine visual effect far long get lot peopl look i thought mayb spielberg direct thi movi realli made hate sand it coars rough get everywher i dont know book end movi end seem rather abrupt
"It's a shame because the first movie was more accurate and loyal to the book (except the Hakonnen being bald) but in this movie they went fine for the first 1.5 hours and then it's a free fall.

The ending was really disappointing and not even close to the book. Where was princess Alia? A really important character that was left out. How long can Jessica be pregnant? It's ridiculous.

Maybe they should have made another movie and give more attention to the final battle.

People who didn't read the book or saw the first movie from 1984 don't know that the plot is different and perhaps that's why they think it's a masterpiece. Well, it's not.",it shame first movi accur loyal book except hakonnen bald movi went fine first hour free fall the end realli disappoint even close book where princess alia a realli import charact left how long jessica pregnant it ridicul mayb made anoth movi give attent final battl peopl didnt read book saw first movi dont know plot differ perhap that think masterpiec well
"It's so rare that you look forward to a film as much as this and then aren't disappointed. It was pure gold, from every angle.

Captivating story, perfectly chosen cast, stunning costumes, awe-inspiring visual effects - a true masterpiece.

The film takes you on a rollercoaster of a journey, from moments of sheer excitement and adventure to chilling darkness.

Part of what makes it so exhilarating is the anticipation of what's next and never truly knowing what to expect.

"Dune Part 2 delivers the best sequel experience ever. Every aspect, from acting to story to music, is simply outstanding. While I'm a huge fan of Timothée, Austin's performance here is equally extraordinary. The storytelling is exquisite, immersing me visually more than Dune Part 1 ever did. As always, there are no words for Hans Zimmer's music. I've never paid this much attention to a movie before. Denis Villeneuve has truly outdone himself with this film, making it his best work yet.

If you haven't watch part 1, watch it before watch part 2. If you like part 1, sure you will like part 2. Is not a traditional style of action of fantasy movie, is more like a cautionary tales that reflect real world religious and politics. Never the less, I would give it a 10 out of 10.

"I'm not sure this is a masterpiece or a game changer. This movie seems trapped in its own style; it doesn't have the loose, inhabitable vibe Star Wars has (sorry to use this as a reference). It might not be its setup, but it feels rigid.

Take Giedi Prime, for instance, which seems like an action movie shot in a modern art museum, with (maybe) cool-looking but silly design choices like a black sun. Then there is an issue with the pacing. There's lots of build-up but an unsatisfying wrap-up with the Sardaukar. The way emotions are evoked, like the way Javier Bardem's character is meant to do at times, feels forced.

Some originally bad-ass characters have poor resolutions, and the action doesn't have the punch you'd expect it to have. Some scenes look absolutely spectacular, but overall, it's style over substance, just not that engaging.",im sure masterpiec game changer thi movi seem trap style doesnt loo inhabit vibe star war sorri use refer it might setup feel rigid take giedi prime instanc seem like action movi shot modern art museum mayb coollook silli design choic like black sun then issu pace there lot buildup unsatisfi wrapup sardaukar the way emot evok like way javier bardem charact meant time feel forc some origin badass charact poor resolut action doesnt punch youd expect some scene look absolut spectacular overal style substanc engag
"Despite Part One largely following the plot of the book quite closely, Part Two takes the film series into unknown territory. Too much of the book has been cut or drastically changed throughout Part Two.

The dialogue has also taken a hit, being overly simplified for modern audiances.

The pacing is hit-and-miss with the movie seeming to rush past major plot points in places and then taking seemingly forever to progress past others.

A number of desert scenes also look incredibly fake whereas Part One was almost seemless with the CGI sand not detracting from the watchability of the film.

The film is watchable, just not as enjoyable as the first film.",despit part one larg follow plot book quit close part two take film seri unknown territori too much book cut drastic chang throughout part two the dialogu also taken hit overli simplifi modern audianc the pace hitandmiss movi seem rush past major plot point place take seemingli forev progress past other a number desert scene also look incred fake wherea part one almost seemless cgi sand detract watchabl film the film watchabl enjoy first film
"I understand I'm in the minority here, and maybe I'm just crazy, but I do not get the high praise of this film, or its predecessor for that matter.

I can't follow the plot at all or understand what's going on, there are a lot of different characters and factions, but I don't get their purpose or motivations. There is also very little action. It was so boring to watch and I'm not easily bored by films.

The visuals effects are very stunning, and it is very pleasant to look at, but besides that and some decent performances, there's not much going for it.

I had to watch this film in 2 sittings, which I never, ever do, not even for 3+ hour films. But I couldn't help myself here, as I was constantly checking how much time was left on the film.

It currently has a 8.5 on IMDb, which puts it in the same league as Alien, Back to the Future and The Lion King, but you're seriously telling me this film is on their level? With some films I don't like, I can at least understand how some people can enjoy them, but with this film I just don't see it.

Anyway I've had my rant, if you like this film then that's fine, but it's not for me and I'll never watch it again, and I'll certainly never understand how this film is the best film of 2024 and considered ""cinema"" by many.

"I am a fan of the books, I highly rated the first film and this sequel is just as good if not better.

I don't much rate Timothy Chalamet as an actor and thought he was cast wrongly as Paul but I thought his performance was better in this film than the first.

Zendaya also gave an improved performance as Chani after her character was given more development, giving her meatier material to work with this time around.

Rebecca Ferguson and Stellan were both decent, following up from their performances in the first film.

Austin Butler gave a good performance as Feyd- Rautha, he pulls the psychopathy of Feyd off well and doesn't camp it up like sting did.

The film follows the second book faithfully and let's the storyline unfold without rushing things along.

"As a reader and book lover must admit, that this movie is beyond and above. Paul Atreides character breathes and lives on screen thanks to the immense and outstanding talent of Timothee Chalamet - here is all that complexity, entangled revenge, sorrow, doubt, love, betrayal, self sacrifice and ambition, downfall of man and rising of a leader. Chalamet definitely would be remembered as the space prince turned warrior, his path through the desert from youthful man fighting his own gifts to a ruler of the galaxy challenging the great houses and fighting his way to the throne.

Apart from the mind blowing acting of the lead characters Villeneuve delivers the most beautiful and breathtaking visuals that contribute to the powerful, heartbreaking, epic deliverance of the story along with the Hans Zimmer masterpiece of a music. Main theme makes you feel the underlying sorrow, the unconditional value of freedom, even above love, the sacrifice ultimate power demands.

"I got really hyped up after reading some article stating that the film became the highest rated movie on IMDB in history, at that point the article mentioned a 9.4 score which was crazy.

Anyway, yesterday I saw the movie at the cinema.

The hero's journey seemed too easy, the first 1.5 hours were slow and rather uneventful. I enjoy Sci-fi but I have seen much better. Of course that the scenery, universe of dunes, cinematic effects were amazing. The leading role was really good as well but overall it was easy and lacked that real struggle, uncertainty and surprize.

It is worth seeing for sure but there are many elements that lack originality, fights and plots that are lazy and rather without enough context, preparation and coherence.

"From the moment the lights dimmed in the IMAX theater, it was clear that Dune Part 2 was going to be an unforgettable cinematic journey. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, this sequel not only continues the epic tale of Paul Atreides and his destiny among the sands of Arrakis but elevates the saga to new heights, both literally and metaphorically, thanks to the immersive IMAX experience.

Picking up where the first part left off, Dune Part 2 delves deeper into the complex politics, culture, and the looming war on Arrakis. The narrative expands on the themes of destiny, power, and survival, challenging characters and audiences alike to ponder the costs of leadership and the sacrifices for peace. Villeneuve masterfully balances the dense lore of Frank Herbert's universe with emotionally charged storytelling, making the intricate plot accessible and deeply engaging.",from moment light dim imax theater clear dune part go unforgett cinemat journey direct deni villeneuv sequel continu epic tale paul atreid destini among sand arraki elev saga new height liter metaphor thank immers imax experi pick first part left dune part delv deeper complex polit cultur loom war arraki the narr expand theme destini power surviv challeng charact audienc alik ponder cost leadership sacrific peac villeneuv master balanc den lore frank herbert univers emot charg storytel make intric plot access deepli engag
"A pretty similar review to the first one although I have to say the second instalment is superior to the first.

It suffers from the same issues as the first film in that it sacrifices all of the nuance and political intrigue of the book, for big screen visuals.

It certainly looks the part, a great job has been done with the realisation of the World itself. All of the problems lie with the nature of the book itself. So much of the beauty and intricacy of the book is held within the characters' internal monologues. Without them huge swathes of the book are left meaningless and empty.

"""Dune Part Two"" is a masterpiece that expands on the epic universe created in the first installment. Director Denis Villeneuve continues to impress with his stunning visuals, breathtaking cinematography, and masterful storytelling.

The film picks up right where the first part left off, delving deeper into the complex characters and political intrigue of Frank Herbert's novel. The performances are exceptional, with Timothée Chalamet once again shining as the conflicted hero, Paul Atreides. The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Zendaya, deliver standout performances that add depth and emotion to the story.

One of the film's greatest strengths is its world-building. From the vast deserts of Arrakis to the futuristic cities of the Imperium, every detail feels meticulously crafted and rich with history. Hans Zimmer's haunting score further immerses the audience in this captivating world, creating a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.

""Dune Part Two"" is a triumph of science fiction filmmaking, seamlessly blending spectacle with substance. It's a must-see for fans of the genre and a testament to Villeneuve's talent as a director.",dune part two masterpiec expand epic univers creat first instal director deni villeneuv continu impress stun visual breathtak cinematographi master storytel the film pick right first part left delv deeper complex charact polit intrigu frank herbert novel the perform except timoth chalamet shine conflict hero paul atreid the support cast includ rebecca ferguson oscar isaac zendaya deliv standout perform add depth emot stori one film greatest strength worldbuild from vast desert arraki futurist citi imperium everi detail feel meticul craft rich histori han zimmer haunt score immers audienc captiv world creat truli unforgett cinemat experi dune part two triumph scienc fiction filmmak seamlessli blend spectacl substanc it mustse fan genr testament villeneuv talent director
"""Dune Part 2"" stands as a cinematic colossus, marking a milestone in the evolution of science fiction film adaptations. Masterfully directed, this sequel not only captures the immersive and complex essence of Frank Herbert's original material but also elevates the narrative to a new level of visual and emotional splendor.

From the outset, the director demonstrates a profound understanding of the narrative, choosing to expand the story in ways that complement and enrich what was established in the first part. While ""Dune Part 1"" took liberties in incorporating an extensive introduction, this risky decision lays the groundwork for the vast world and complex characters now explored with greater depth. In ""Dune Part 2,"" this world unfolds with overwhelming beauty, captivating the viewer in its vastness and intricacy.

The cast shines brightly, with each actor embodying their character with a mix of vulnerability and strength that is seldom seen. The characters are well-developed, showing convincing growth arcs that reflect the central themes of power, destiny, and humanity that Herbert wove into his work. This depth of characterization ensures that ""Dune Part 2"" is not just a visual experience but also one that resonates emotionally.

The art direction and visual effects are of stellar quality, creating desert landscapes that are both majestic and relentless. The attention to detail in each scene, from the vast sand dunes to the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes, transports the viewer to a world that, though alien, feels tangible and real. The cinematography masterfully captures this splendor, using a color palette that reflects both the beauty and brutality of the Dune universe.

The sound design and soundtrack play a crucial role in immersing the viewer. The vibrant and enveloping sound not only complements the magnitude of the visual scenes but also deepens the emotional connection with the story. The music, both ethereal and powerful, elevates every moment, from epic battles to tension-filled silences, creating an auditory experience as impactful as the visual one.

""Dune Part 2"" not only meets the expectations set by its predecessor but surpasses them, establishing itself as a masterpiece in its own right. The film delves into complex themes with a maturity and depth seldom seen in science fiction cinema. The exploration of politics, religion, and ecology, central themes in Herbert's book, is handled with subtlety and complexity that enriches the narrative, inviting reflection.

"A really accurate representation of the book. Although there are some changed elements, still an amazing film. The portrayal of the Harkonnens is breathtaking, the music and the effects are exhiliraring and the lead actors play impeccably well, especially Timothy. Seeing as movies today often do not tell the whole story as it should be told, I would say that this film almost perfectly envisions how a book adaptation should be made. Moreover, the visual effects are stunning, the sandworms are depicted perfectly and the use of more practical effects over CGI is something that today's cinema lacks, which this films executes perfectly.",a realli accur represent book although chang element still amaz film the portray harkonnen breathtak music effect exhilirar lead actor play impecc well especi timothi see movi today often tell whole stori told i would say film almost perfectli envis book adapt made moreov visual effect stun sandworm depict perfectli use practic effect cgi someth today cinema lack film execut perfectli
"This movie is simply a masterpiece. It will be a pillar of science fiction genre. Hat off to Denis, as he is one of the best directors of his generation. It still amazes me how this man can't do an average movie. He understands how movies works, he puts the accents on character development, story, visuals, sound, to deliver us immersive experiences like no others. Everything works perfectly in this movie. I just didn't want it to end. It shoks me to see people rating movies 1/10 just because Zendaya was in it, or because it's too long, or because they didn't like the music (it just goes to show how little some people understand movies and the effort put by the creators to offer the best cinematic experience possible. As a fun fact, no director or producer starts off by wanting to do a bad movie. Even the most mediocre movies I can't rate them with less than 5 or 4 stars, let alone give it a 1 star because I didn't like one thing, completely ignoring the other things that make it great). Writing this I feel the need to go see it one more time :) Good day my fellow movie lovers.",thi movi simpli masterpiec it pillar scienc fiction genr hat deni one best director gener it still amaz man cant averag movi he understand movi work put accent charact develop stori visual sound deliv u immers experi like other everyth work perfectli movi i didnt want end it shok see peopl rate movi zendaya long didnt like music goe show littl peopl understand movi effort put creator offer best cinemat experi possibl a fun fact director produc start want bad movi even mediocr movi i cant rate less star let alon give star i didnt like one thing complet ignor thing make great write i feel need go see one time good day fellow movi lover
"As great as the visuals are, the cgi, the special effects, the explosions, the humongous digital sets, the ships & vehicles, the lore and the look, the movie has zero substance, like a crash test dummy with half a brain. Dune One had the experience of not seeing these visuals before, but now that they're established, so Two feels like a retread and turns into one of Villenueve's more blander efforts. Now, of course, I'm criticizing a $100,000,000 production with some of the greatest crews, actors and director of a generation, but sorry, it fell short for me. Will look forward to Messiah, hoping for some more heart and guts.",a great visual cgi special effect explos humong digit set ship vehicl lore look movi zero substanc like crash test dummi half brain dune one experi see visual theyr establish two feel like retread turn one villenuev blander effort now cours im critic product greatest crew actor director gener sorri fell short will look forward messiah hope heart gut
"This is one of the best movies i've ever watched. GOOOSEBUMPS!!!!

I Think i puts the whole Dune univers in another great movie perspective. This follow-up on the Dune Part 1 is just epic. The universe build-up from the first movie to the action packed secound movie is so amazing. Furthermore the whole movie had me on the edge of the Seat. I really Think it gave the future for sci-fi a real competition and generelly theres is a Long distance between such great Universe describtions.

"Denis Villeneuve's continuation of Frank Herbert's epic ""Dune"" delivers a cinematic experience that is both awe-inspiring and demanding.

The film maintains the visual grandeur of its predecessor, presenting the expansive desert landscapes of Arrakis in breathtaking detail. Villeneuve continues to employ outstanding special effects and meticulously crafted sets that fully immerse the audience in the world of ""Dune.""

Hans Zimmer's score once again provides an impressive musical backdrop that perfectly complements the film's mood. The music enhances the emotional depth of the scenes, creating an atmospheric richness that captivates the viewer. Zimmer's powerful and evocative soundtrack significantly contributes to the film's epic feel.

The performances are consistently strong. Timothée Chalamet portrays Paul Atreides with a blend of vulnerability and resolve, making his journey as a rising leader believable. Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, while Zendaya takes on a more prominent role as Chani, with her chemistry with Chalamet being notably palpable. Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen and Javier Bardem as Stilgar bring necessary depth and intensity to their roles.

However, a notable critique is the film's occasional sluggishness. While the detailed portrayal of the world and character development is appreciated, the narrative sometimes drags. Some scenes feel extended and could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a brisker pace. This languid pacing can occasionally pull the viewer out of the story and diminish the suspense.

Overall, the film is an immensely powerful continuation that impresses both visually and audibly. Hans Zimmer's music and the strong performances contribute significantly to the film's atmosphere. Despite the episodic slow spots, which can make the viewing experience somewhat taxing, the film remains essential for fans of the first part and the science fiction genre who are ready to engage in a profound and visually opulent adventure.",deni villeneuv continu frank herbert epic dune deliv cinemat experi aweinspir demand the film maintain visual grandeur predecessor present expans desert landscap arraki breathtak detail villeneuv continu employ outstand special effect meticul craft set fulli immers audienc world dune han zimmer score provid impress music backdrop perfectli complement film mood the music enhanc emot depth scene creat atmospher rich captiv viewer zimmer power evoc soundtrack significantli contribut film epic feel the perform consist strong timoth chalamet portray paul atreid blend vulner resolv make journey rise leader believ rebecca ferguson shine ladi jessica zendaya take promin role chani chemistri chalamet notabl palpabl stellan skarsgrd baron harkonnen javier bardem stilgar bring necessari depth intens role howev notabl critiqu film occasion sluggish while detail portray world charact develop appreci narr sometim drag some scene feel extend could benefit tighter edit maintain brisker pace thi languid pace occasion pull viewer stori diminish suspens overal film immens power continu impress visual audibl han zimmer music strong perform contribut significantli film atmospher despit episod slow spot make view experi somewhat tax film remain essenti fan first part scienc fiction genr readi engag profound visual opul adventur
"Half the lovie is in the dark, the character have a terrible voice and everyone looks angry, the plot is full of holes and incomprehensible, the leader is no leader, incredibly stupid, all appearance and not content. One of the worst movie i ever saw.

Plot: The plot revolves a struggle for power between two noble houses-the Atreides and Harkonnens-centered on the desert planet of Arrakis, which is the only known source of the Spice, the most valuable substance in the universe, because it is necessary for interstellar navigation and also greatly extends human lifespan. Paul Atreides brcomes the leader of the fremen because they believe he his the messiah. To proof himself he rides a giant worm and drinks the water of life, which is blue piss worm.

"Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film that is sure to leave a lasting impression. The story is epic in scope, yet it never loses sight of the personal stakes involved. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the performances are top-notch. Timothée Chalamet is particularly good as Paul Atreides, and he brings a real depth and nuance to the role. The film is also beautifully shot, with stunning cinematography and special effects. The music is also incredible, and it really helps to create an immersive and atmospheric experience.

"I read the book around when the first part of Dune was released. So I knew what would happen story-wise. But while watching part two I realized it's not just about the main plot. It's the music, it's the visuals, the sounds, the acting, the rawness.

I think everything in this movie is perfect, when you see it from a visual and sound perspective.

While I think the story is wonderful, I feel it was almost too fast phased. I discussed with friends who has not read the book about the story. Which they did not really understand at all times. Because of the movies fast phase in the second half of the movie.

I won't discuss these specific storywise stuff. But when you see the movie from a book-perspective. The story is exceptional and rich.

While I know you can't really copy-paste the book to the movie. It still contains the main plot points and does so with excellence. But I can't deny that I wanted to see some more things that was included in the book but not in the movie.

Certain characters, cough cough.. Seemed to be forgotten from the first part.

But overall I totally loved the movie. And I also like that it takes it's own little road to make it a ""better"" cinematic experience. But I know that some will whine about the difference between book and movie. I think it's great that they make the movie in a way that still cherish the source material but does some changes probably are necessary for production and overall experience.

If you'll whine about the movie not being exactly like the book you should just go read the book. I really hope an extended cut will be released for us all to enjoy this movie in 4h instead of 3.

I would perhaps put this movie in the 8.5+ area. But since this is imdb it deserves a 10.

"Absolutely mesmerising from start to finish, a masterclass in storytelling and a visual spectacle... Dune part 2 was executed to perfection and is a love letter to the fans who've read the book along with the people who haven't, I strongly suggest reading the book as Villeneuve leaves a lot unsaid (a lot of internal monologue within the book) all while implying it through the actions of the characters, and as someone who has read the book, it was so wonderful to experience that. The film itself is truly beautiful, heartbreaking and full of lessons within lessons that give a true insight into the struggles of people in our world. I think the film truly encapsulates the idea of 'there are no sides' that the books tried so hard to impart, thank you Denis Villeneuve for bringing a story I loved so much, to life, in the most spectacular fashion.",absolut mesmeris start finish masterclass storytel visual spectacl dune part execut perfect love letter fan whove read book along peopl havent i strongli suggest read book villeneuv leav lot unsaid lot intern monologu within book impli action charact someon read book wonder experi the film truli beauti heartbreak full lesson within lesson give true insight struggl peopl world i think film truli encapsul idea side book tri hard impart thank deni villeneuv bring stori i love much life spectacular fashion

The music from Hans Zimmer combine perfect with movie scenes. The script was extremely well written and perfectly thought through. It's have a very very good story, has a good action and has a little bit romantic but not much. When you watch this movie you feel every scene with emotional.

"I have no critic really, I'm still processing.. I'm even satisfied by the changes that they made at the end of the story.. High key, I hope Monsieur Villeneuve did a Director's cut with more graphic scenes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't really missing, but it would of added a layer to it all and would of given more depth to a few characters, yes especially Feyd-Rautha, the brutalist terror wasn't explicit enough for me.

Zendaya was brilliant, she truly showed no fear on the screen in a way I rarely seen anyone do it before.

But truly while watching it, you just feel how much care everyone who has worked on this movie has giving, flawless.

I left the cinema feeling like I just got taught a few lessons and I want to feel and understand more..

Can't wait to be blown way by Dune Messiah.

"Just great. Impressive pictures, great costumes. Finally serious sci-fi again! No stupid jokes, no black and white plot so simple you want to scream. The characters are complex and the protagonists are not just good, they don't have a clean slate. Everyone has his own agenda.

A few things have been changed from the book, but subtly and, in my opinion, for the better! The role of the female characters, and especially the Bene Gesserit, has been significantly enhanced. That fits well into the story. In the books they were too passive, too small for me. The Bene Gesserit are incredibly powerful, and it makes sense to put this in the foreground. Jessica and Chani also have significantly more personality, act more independently and have their own ideas.

The ending is not a sweet Hollywood-typical everything will be fine now ending. There will be at least one more sequel. The material will not be easy to implement on film if you know the books and the rest of the story. But so far, Villeneuve made an outstanding job!",just great impress pictur great costum final seriou scifi no stupid joke black white plot simpl want scream the charact complex protagonist good dont clean slate everyon agenda a thing chang book subtli opinion better the role femal charact especi bene gesserit significantli enhanc that fit well stori in book passiv small the bene gesserit incred power make sen put foreground jessica chani also significantli person act independ idea the end sweet hollywoodtyp everyth fine end there least one sequel the materi easi implement film know book rest stori but far villeneuv made outstand job
"Bold statement incoming: the combination of 'Dune Part One' and 'Dune Part Two' has officially become my favorite film adaptation of a book. The profound impact of Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by Denis Villeneuve's visionary homage. This is the book come to life, and if you appreciate the book, the movie should resonate deeply with you.

I struggle to think of a better-executed sequel; though 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight' are certainly in the running, 'Dune Part Two' excels beyond both. Its strength lies in the combination of jaw-dropping world-building, extraordinary acting, and a script that allows the audio-visual experience to unfold effortlessly. 'Dune' is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in Muslim culture and Western Colonialism's quest for natural resources, which is even more relevant today as it was nearly 50 years ago when the book was written (i.e., ""The Spice,"" which always equated to oil in my mind).

Aesthetically, the film has no equal, which is no surprise considering the director's extraordinary track record, including 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Arrival', and 'Sicario', all of which are in my Top 50 films of all time and deserving of a perfect 10/10, along with 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' exceeds its predecessor in every way, elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid 90 minutes. It has no weak link, no tonal inconsistency, and no extended dip in energy or over-explanation in which to lose the viewer. It is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top 5 all-time (I will reserve final judgment until I can see it in 70mm IMAX next week).",bold statement incom combin dune part one dune part two offici becom favorit film adapt book the profound impact frank herbert epic scienc fiction masterpiec literatur religion overshadow deni villeneuv visionari homag thi book come life appreci book movi reson deepli i struggl think betterexecut sequel though the empir strike back the dark knight certainli run dune part two excel beyond it strength lie combin jawdrop worldbuild extraordinari act script allow audiovisu experi unfold effortlessli dune spiritu journey deepli root muslim cultur western coloni quest natur resourc even relev today nearli year ago book written ie the spice alway equat oil mind aesthet film equal surpris consid director extraordinari track record includ blade runner arriv sicario top film time deserv perfect along dune part one dune part two exce predecessor everi way elev stori climact fashion heart mind posit buzz solid minut it weak link tonal inconsist extend dip energi overexplan lose viewer it perfect film perspect like crack top alltim i reserv final judgment i see mm imax next week
"I honestly don't know which movie these 10/10 people have watched but it cannot be Dune Part Two.

This movie was ponderously boring, the 'riding the worms"" scenes were laughable, minute creatures on gigantic worms supposedly able to control them with paperclip hooks and cotton thread... I don't think so. The scale just looked daft.

Casting Christopher Walken as the Emperor was a mistake and did not work at all, what a mis-cast that was. I can't say I connected to any of the characters and it was frustrating because I wanted this movie to be epic, as it was I'd rather have spent a night letting my girlfriend pull nostril hairs out of my nose, at least it would have had tears, tension, intense emotion, laughter, and relief.

I can't really be bothered to do a full review, I've given it 3 stars because of the CGI.",i honestli dont know movi peopl watch cannot dune part two thi movi ponder bore ride worm scene laughabl minut creatur gigant worm supposedli abl control paperclip hook cotton thread i dont think the scale look daft cast christoph walken emperor mistak work miscast i cant say i connect charact frustrat i want movi epic id rather spent night let girlfriend pull nostril hair nose least would tear tension intens emot laughter relief i cant realli bother full review ive given star cgi

"Dune Part Two was a perfect sequel to Villeneuve's first part. He accomplished all of the book's major plot points while also delivering stunning performances and visuals, a fantastic execution of unexpected humor with a passionate performance from Javier Bardem.

Most films in recent years only dream of having the brilliance of this film and much of that is due to the director of photography, Greig Fraser, one of the best. This film will be remembered as one of the ziggurats of modern science fiction and deserves all the laurels it will receive.

It hasn't been long since a franchise and a singular film captivated and demonstrated so much passion pouring onto the screen. This story, these characters, this planet. Dune comes to fight for its place in the history of science fiction cinema. It's a disservice to the sound and photography experience not to see this film in IMAX, you feel part of each scene.

"Here it comes Dune Part Two with the most rewarding ending since The Silence of the Lambs.

I have seen thousands of movies in my lifetime but Dune Part Two stands out for its commitment to cinema itself.

A superb job by team Villeneuve including Fraser for cinematography, Walker for editing and Zimmer for scoring.

I rarely have these kind of emotions but Dune Part Two has been highly rewarding thanks to Frank Herbert's novel of 1965.

There is no doubt that director Denis Villeneuve did his homework in order to bring a book of generation to the big screen.

This is filmmaking at its finest. Chamalet and Zendaya nail it with all the supporting cast.

"Nice atmosphere. Mortuary, but somehow nice as a working product. Always tragic and godly music but nothing happens. Or too little. Too much tension for nothing. Slow moves. Clasic hero looks for too many characters.

Nice acting from the big actors (those 4) and Zendaya. The rest were destroyed by copy - paste recipe ( I'm sure they can do more).

So, basically, same as the first one. But further on the story line. Just a mm further.

Imagine a great set, great sound (too much maybe), but not much to see, just drama and drama again. With no support in story, just for coolness.

Unfortunately, like many modern movies, it looks amazing (the work riding scene alone was unreal), but, it also jumps from scene to scene with no real coherence. I understand a movie is a series of shots edited into scenes that make up a movie. However, the scenes have to flow together to create a coherent narrative. Maybe it's just me, but so many films these days seem to have a disjointed narrative, ie, jumping from scene to scene without the proper flow. This film seems to be no exception.

"I went in blind, aware of the hype and praise but giving it a fair chance.

First of all, there are some great scenes, no doubt. The first 45 minutes were pretty good.

However, it is simply too long. Too long means it gets boring and monotonous, and like some astute critics have said, the problem of it lingers in the question of, ""why should I care?"". Sure, there are religious and political elements that carry truth, but ultimately they come across as cliche.

Basically, you have a quasi biblical savior story here (I guess you can just compare it to Neo in the Matrix), with his journey of being the ""one"", the savior. The problem is: we've seen it all before.

As much as I was immersed in the visuals and interesting and grand visual scenes, by the one hour point, u couldn't help but to check my watch and how much time was left. Then, it picked up again for fifteen minutes before becoming boring again.

This will suffice as a sci fi experience, and I can see fans of the book loving it maybe, but it just lost me about halfway through. I won't deny the reviews and arguments that say part I was probably better.

Masterpiece? Certain ""scenes"" scattered about it were, but overall, it is just too long and needs serious editing to be a true one.

This film being a masterpiece is simply an understatement. It's practically perfect. I genuinely have not a single critique that I can think of. This is the best experience with a film I probably have ever had.

I'm going to split this up into two parts, the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that I need to address.

Spoiler Free:

Where do I even begin... from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal. If you liked Dune 2021 at least a faint bit you will most likely love this. Everything from the first film is elevated tenfold. You can feel the amount of pure passion and love that Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project. Easily another Oscar sweep for Dune, this time it'll most likely win Best Picture because I can't fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future. Visually unexplainably beautiful. If you get the chance you need to watch it in IMAX or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can. The black and white Feyd-Rautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection, hell that's just one of the scenes I can say that for. This movie has at least ten of the most bad-ass shots I've ever seen. Hans Zimmer's score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by Greig Fraser's visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and sound.

The conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive, that we understand what they're going through, the dire decisions they have to make, and what it will cost them. The commentary on faith, purpose, and what is too far? It's so much more than a pretty sci-film movie with cool sounds, there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail. From giant epic battles to deep, personal, emotional, and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily Denis Viellenueves Magnum Opus.

The entire cast bodies every roll. Timothee Chalamet is the perfect Paul Atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this Aura that I haven't seen in a very long time, may be the best character ever written that I've seen. If you don't care about this film at all that's okay, but please watch it to see his performance at least. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and, again, is transformed into a performance I could see getting him another Oscar Nomination. Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica has this presence that I can't even put into words. Zendaya's Chani has this beautiful chemistry with Chalamet's Paul Atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayed.

I LOVED the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way I haven't seen anything close to it.

This is absolute Sci-Fi perfection. This is tied or even surpasses Empire as the best Sci-Fi film of all time and is the easiest top four I have ever put on this account, and it won't leave that's for sure. Every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told. I heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites, but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was. Genuinely cannot think of a complaint. I commented on the first Dune how I wish there was an extended edition, not needed anymore. Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done better. He elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful. The only thing that saddens me is that Frank Herbert himself couldn't have watched this, I just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a novel.

I can't express what this movie means to me, I'll be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I've thrown around the phrase ""This is my Empire Strikes Back"" a few times like when I watched Endgame for example, but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see it all unfold in IMAX with a packed theater of pure Dune fans. It felt like home.

LONG LIVE CINEMA.

SPOILERS: .

. .

. THEY GAVE GURNEY HIS BALISET!!!!! I genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it. Denis' adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time (outside of his first Dune) just increases the quality.

I LOVED what he did with Princess Irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter, such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book. Actually, Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that weren't in the novel in the first place. We get so much Rabban which makes me so happy, I was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because he's a pretty important character who we don't see much action from already in the book. So us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great. I can't even begin to talk about Feyd-Rautha... what a character, his presence is only matched by Muad'dib himself (who I will get to shortly). He's so menacing and evil... I love him. Getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and I'm so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and Muad'dib especially the added Gom Jabbar that I don't recall being a part of the novel, hell 90% of his scenes weren't in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that it's as if it was all a part of the original writing.

Paul Atreides, Muad'dib, Usul, Kwisatz Harderach, Lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen. I've said it already a few times, but the AURA that Chalamet brings to this character is something I can't put into words and is something that needs to be experienced. The shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed. The expressions in his eyes, the way he presents himself, all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being The One. I remember after reading the book I revisited Dune 2021 and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the Baron is Lady Jessica's Father/ Paul's Grandfather. I remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried. I will never put an ounce of doubt on Villeneuve ever again. The way that it's revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where you'd think that it was written like that originally. Paul's conflict is so well displayed I loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken. It's exactly what Frank Herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought Paul was a perfect hero, Denis handled that misconception perfectly and I can't wait for Dune Messiah (God please let it be greenlit) to see him fully handle the aftermath. That means I'm going to be reading Dune Messiah ASAP.

I thought the choice of Alia not being born and no real mention of Leto II was very interesting but definitely didn't take anything away from the film. It definitely would be weird and difficult to have a four-year-old act like an all-knowing Bene Gesserit woman. I love how it also allowed for the chance of Paul killing the Baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than Alia doing it. Speaking of satisfying death I loved how Gurney was the one who was able to kill Rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying. Lady Jessica talking to Alia with her still in the womb I thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the Bene Gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the mother-daughter bond.

Every battle (especially the final one) has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched. I was grinning from ear to ear so much that I wish I had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing. The Atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The Feyd-Rautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The final battle between Muad'dib and Feyd-Rautha is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The world-building as we dive further into Arrakis and Giedi Prime is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The conflicts between Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Atreides, Harkonnen, Sardaukar, and Guild, is one of the coolest things I'll ever see.

I could type for years, but I need to just let this soak for a bit, I'll be writing more with every watch of this I have.",long live the fighter thi film masterpiec simpli understat it practic perfect

"This is how to feed the beast known as fans of DUNE The visuals the sound. The atmosphere. It was just full package.

Though there were a few things I kinda wanted to get more the story around instead of the blissful visuals with no dialogue. I tried to nitpick on the cgi but i found it stunning.

More of the Bene Gesserits would have been perfect The lack of certain character in the ending was a strange choice? Alia & her Gom Jabbar?

The lack of ""the weirding way"" & more focus on religious fanatics & brute violence was a bold choice But it did kind of work with the storytelling.

As with all movies they tend to stray a bit from the source. But I really enjoyed it.

And this movie can proudly crown itself a sequel better than the first instalment.

Well done.",thi feed beast known fan dune the visual sound the atmospher it full packag though thing i kinda want get stori around instead bliss visual dialogu i tri nitpick cgi found stun more bene gesserit would perfect the lack certain charact end strang choic alia gom jabbar the lack weird way focu religi fanat brute violenc bold choic but kind work storytel a movi tend stray bit sourc but i realli enjoy and movi proudli crown sequel better first instal well done
"Dennis Villeneuve is a filmmaker with a very singular vision. He has made some of the best sc-fi movies of the last decade and Dune Part Two is no exception.

I've now seen the movie in IMAX and 70mm film respectively.

From a technical standpoint this film is a masterclass in cinematography and visual storytelling.

Every actor does their absolute best to portray fully fleshed out characters. Stand outs in the movie are Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler and Zendaya.

This is truly a space epic for the ages and I can confidently say that Dennis Villeneuve will enter the upper echelon of masterful directors.

In fact whole cast did such a good job and i loved each one of the performances. Hans Zimmer also made a masterpiece. I couldn't image someone else making music for this movie.

"I had not read any of the Dune books so the only guide I had to the story and characters was the first film. I thought Dune was OK-ish but nothing special, it didn't grab me at all. I hadn't intended to see Dune II but did so after reading the many good reviews. I'm afraid my take on this one was pretty much the same as that on the first. At times it looked like whole scenes had been missed out, as though they were being saved for an extended-edition DVD, and so it was very difficult for me to follow the story as there seemed to be no continuity and no rationale for what was actually taking place on screen. Will I be going to see Dune III, as inevitably there will be one, probably not. Rated 6 purely for the special effects.",i read dune book guid i stori charact first film i thought dune okish noth special didnt grab i hadnt intend see dune ii read mani good review im afraid take one pretti much first at time look like whole scene miss though save extendededit dvd difficult follow stori seem continu rational actual take place screen will i go see dune iii inevit one probabl rate pure special effect
"Dune Part Two is one of the best movies of this generation and that might even be an understatement. It is a practically flawless movie with many aspects that just transcend our current expectations for filmmaking and sets a new standard of excellence.

The visuals for this movie are so breathtaking it seems almost a disservice to try and put it into words. Intoxicating. Galvanizing. Hair-raising. Heart-stopping. Awe-inspiring. Spine-tingling. Soul-stirring. These words alone couldn't describe the transcendence and otherworldly feeling you get experiencing this movie on the big screen on IMAX so do yourself a favor and book that ticket NOW.

Hans Zimmer completely outdoes himself again with a captivating score that somehow not only rivals but surpasses his previous Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score from Dune Part One.

Timothee Chalamet is an absolute star. His progression and development as Paul Atreides is so raw and captivating and I believe it's completely within reason to say that this movie cemented his status as one of the best actors of this next generation. Speaking of the best actors of this generation, Austin Butler was also a standout for his portrayal as the extremely menacing Feyd-Rautha. Notable performances also include the incredible Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem.

Overall, this is simply an unforgettable experience and masterpiece of a movie that demands immediate indulgence. It was a visual feast that you will walk away from still digesting what in the world you just watched. You will be leaving full to your stomach and yet hungry enough to go back for seconds. And thirds. And fourths....

"Excellent visuals, great cast and very close to the book. That's something already rare in today's movies... but not enough for me to shout at a miracle. The defect of the movie is the pace: slow and self indulgent, at least 20-30 minutes longer than needed. Another weak point from my perspective is the almost completely absence of meaningful dialogues and epic lines. I always felt a movie that doesn't have at least 3 to 5 lines to be recalled as soon as you're out of the theater, it's not a great movie. That said, the experience was pleasant even if long and the photography is more enjoyable on big screen.",excel visual great cast close book that someth alreadi rare today movi enough shout miracl the defect movi pace slow self indulg least minut longer need anoth weak point perspect almost complet absenc meaning dialogu epic line i alway felt movi doesnt least line recal soon your theater great movi that said experi pleasant even long photographi enjoy big screen
"Dune is no Game of thrones (I understand that) but imagine how terrible it would've been if GOT was just a movie/s and Battle of b*stards was shown in 2 minutes scene. Reverse it and imagine if Dune was a TV show. The romance between Paul and Chani were developed through episodes, the acceptance of paul into the Freman world were properly established,a thrilling fight between Paul and Feyd and so many other things; it could've not only made total sense but also would've connected to the audience and done a justice to the story.

As many people have said and in my opinion-Dune:part two is simply boring, despite having the stunning visuals and amazing score. Denis Villeneuve has put more focus on aesthetics than genuine storytelling and it does the real damage. Pacing of the movie is irregular where it tries to crammed lots of information in few scenes in the middle, the ending is simply filling and unsatisfying.

One big reason that it falls flat is because it tries to put few books worth of story into 2h46m. Some die hard fans are pulling their hair that(as per the books) it fails to describe the reasoning behind many things or it's a wrong story, And To the first time viewer it seems Just another story of two sides fighting, nothing more.

Depth in the story , development of character arcs and suspense are the few things that could have make it great TV,but that requires time for thr story of this scale. Which could've only done it by making it a show. As a movie it feels rushed.",dune game throne i understand imagin terribl wouldv got movi battl bstard shown minut scene revers imagin dune tv show the romanc paul chani develop episod accept paul freman world properli establisheda thrill fight paul feyd mani thing couldv made total sen also wouldv connect audienc done justic stori a mani peopl said opiniondunepart two simpli bore despit stun visual amaz score deni villeneuv put focu aesthet genuin storytel real damag pace movi irregular tri cram lot inform scene middl end simpli fill unsatisfi one big reason fall flat tri put book worth stori hm some die hard fan pull hair thata per book fail describ reason behind mani thing wrong stori and to first time viewer seem just anoth stori two side fight noth depth stori develop charact arc suspens thing could make great tvbut requir time thr stori scale which couldv done make show a movi feel rush

"It's up to the people who love good movies to get out to the theaters when they make a movie like this. I grew up watching Dune on tv at least a dozen times. I think it did more with less, but this movie is on all fronts much better and deserves my highest rating. It wasn't perfect but when you spend almost 3 hours in a theater and never once want to leave your seat... We had 9 people in our group and everyone loved it so that is another reason for the 10/10.

"Dune 2

I enjoyed it immensely!

This started continuously from the first movie, and luckily I rewatched the first movie in preparation, I would suggest this is a must! Again the movie was merciless, if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered, and perhaps should go home at this point lol

Part 2 of the book is about the coming true of the Arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a ""green paradise"". So it is dark and religiously ""top heavy"", and so was this movie. A brooding dark serious movie with Paul and Jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece Marshall combats. No gags here!

Mr Villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous times.

Without undermining the brilliant acting from the cast, Timothee Chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah, he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving. The element about Paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time, whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively. Secondly, we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtleties.

There were several divergences from the book, Paul's integration into the Fremen took 3 years and Alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife, this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie. Secondly Chani stands by Paul's side throughout even through a political marriage, the movie diverges from this. However Mr Villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and Frank Herbert's intentions were respected.

Perhaps more controversial, and of course it's my opinion, there was, unfortunately, to my mind, one glaring problem, there just was no on-screen chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya, it just didn't work, also her acting grated, she seemed to have attended the AB school of acting, using just 2 faces that conveyed petulance, irritation or indeed trapped wind! She just overworked most of it as if it was for TV, we all know, for movie acting ""less is more"", she looked the part, but there just was just no sexual frisson, and the accent was too american, everyone else modified their to be from ""nowhere"" exactly, so she was miscast. I have seen this actress now in Spider-Man, Euphoria and now this, she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial, just no heft! Florence Pugh would have made a better Chani as that lady has the skills when she's humble!

I thought Austin Butler was brilliant as the evil nephew, bulked up and without eyebrows, and the teeth, it was a terrific transformation and I love it!

The music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences, the CGI set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity, we were there, we had a parched throat and sand in our faces, I did the sand walk back to the underground lol!

"This movie for sure is a cinematic visual treat..plus the terrific attention to details in costumes and makeup HOWEVER, story wise whats up with the casting??? I wish Hollywood reps would understand shoving dozen famous actors in a movie doesn't make a good one, First of all, am I the only one who felt zero charisma from chalamet??? The leader role doesn't suit him he sound like a little kid when shouting not to mention his weak physics for a trained fighter imagine kit Harrington in his place for example

Second of all, enough with zendaya in every freaking project the girl can't act plus her zero chemistry and sibling energy with timothee..her face sure fits angry fierce scenes but she lacks the feminine romantic yet powerfull vibes

Finally, whats up with villains in this story you hybe them so much for them to die instantly in the most weak stupid predictable way possible...

"Undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Most movies nowadays try to wow you with either visuals, action, character development, and seemingly less and less so everyday with a reasonable plot. This movie manages to check off every box. It is hard to pinpoint an actor in it that wasn't superb in their role. The visual effects, especially in IMAX , are stunning and are not simply artistic in nature, but actually work to advance the plot.

The film is pieced together so brilliantly with each act seamlessly fitting in with the last. The score by Zimmer is unsurprisingly absolute perfection as well.

For the length of the movie it actually feels quite short which is a huge achievement and shows how immersed you become in Villneuve's world.

However, I would have liked to see more of Feyd Rautha. They had an epic scene of his in the Harkonnen arena, but not too much else to develop him for his final battle against Paul. I also would have liked to see the Sardaukar put up a little better of a fight. They somehow went from the empires greatest fighters to pretty pathetic. Perhaps this was to show how strong Paul and his forces had become, but it just seemed a bit too easy. Still these are just personal aspects I would have liked to see and are not issues in the movie itself.

Overall, an epic movie, and the trilogy is likely to be sitting right alongside The Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars movies when all is said and done.

"What a masterpiece. This is the new Empire Strikes Back for me. Star Wars has and always will be my favorite franchise, then is The Dark Knight Trilogy. Before watching Dune Part One and Dune Part Two, Middle Earth was my third favorite franchise, now I think Dune is my third favorite duology (hoping franchise in a future). I can't wait for more movies of Dune. The ending was speechless. I need moreeeeee!!!!!! Austin Butler was scary as hell as Feyd the new villain. His portrayal was phenomenal as Elvis. And Timothee Challamet as Paul Artreides, was spectacular. The new Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) aka Darth Vader. This movie is in my Top 5 favorite film in history. It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes. I saw it on IMAX and is a must see on the big screen. Highly recommend this film on IMAX.",what masterpiec thi new empir strike back star war alway favorit franchis the dark knight trilog befor watch dune part one dune part two middl earth third favorit franchis i think dune third favorit duolog hope franchis futur i cant wait movi dune the end speechless i need moreeeee austin butler scari hell feyd new villain hi portray phenomen elvi and timothe challamet paul artreid spectacular the new anakin skywalk chosen one aka darth vader thi movi top favorit film histori it epic intens sometim dark it like star war if your star war fan your go enjoy film the fight epic the dialogu act cinematographi visual effect phenomen ive seen twice theater long enjoy durat movi minut i saw imax must see big screen highli recommend film imax
"First of all, this movie isn't for everyone. It isn't a movie you go to see with your friends expecting action. It also isn't a basic sci-fi movie, it's different. Main theme, in my opinion, is the importance of relegion and politics, and the influence it has on us. The Bene-Gesserit were shown so beautifully in this movie-their role, influence and power they have in Dune universe. Frank Herbert is a genius for his time, and the themes he writes about are relevant, both then and nowdays. This movie is absolutely worthy of every praise it gets. Many might not understand it because they haven't read the book, and that willa affect their opinion of this movie, but i think it's fantastic. Yes, a few thing were changed, not necessarily for the better, but it has to be that way in order for such a complex piece to be understood to the broather audience.

The first and second part are so much different (in a good way). The chang that characters go through (Paul, Jessica) are so incredibly shown, and you can clearly see that they are a a completely different person by the end of the second movie.

Special praises to Denis Villeneuve, he is a genius I got goosebumps far too much times throughout this movie because of the music which is absolutely mesmerizing.

I really hope there will be a third part, and can't wait to go and see this movie many more tikes in theaters.",first movi isnt everyon it isnt movi go see friend expect action it also isnt basic scifi movi differ main theme opinion import relegion polit influenc u the benegesserit shown beauti movietheir role influenc power dune univers frank herbert geniu time theme write relev nowday thi movi absolut worthi everi prais get mani might understand havent read book willa affect opinion movi think fantast ye thing chang necessarili better way order complex piec understood broather audienc the first second part much differ good way the chang charact go paul jessica incred shown clearli see complet differ person end second movi special prais deni villeneuv geniu i got goosebump far much time throughout movi music absolut mesmer i realli hope third part cant wait go see movi mani tike theater
"I saw this opening weekend in 4DX at Regal Theaters (the theater where the seats move, water sprays in the air, air blasts you, the theater fills with smoke, lightning flashes, etc.) I had a completely amazing experience with the movie. Denis Villeneuve is one of my least favorite directors. I thought Prisoners sucked, Blade Runner sucked, and Arrival sucked. But his vision came to completion with this installment of the Dune series. His first Dune movie, in 2021, was rather bland all-around. This one was filled with action sequences to the brim. I also commend him with his efforts in artistic cinema with the black and white Harkonnen world. Austin Butler was really great, as was Zendaya. There are many flaws in the movie such as where it skips parts of the books or changes them, mechanics of some of the sci-fi elements, and some of the actors' lack of commitment to their roles. But overall, it was a really fun and entertaining movie that impressed me a lot.

"""Dune: Part 2"" not only surpasses its predecessor but also stands as a cinematic triumph reminiscent of ""Return of the Jedi."" While the first installment provided a rich context and a tantalizing glimpse into the expansive universe of Dune, the second part truly brings the saga to life, delivering the depth, drama, and grandeur fans have eagerly anticipated.

From the very first frame, it's evident that ""Dune: Part 2"" is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the vast and intricate landscapes of Arrakis with stunning clarity and beauty. Every scene is meticulously crafted, drawing viewers deeper into the story's rich tapestry. The special effects are equally impressive, seamlessly blending with the narrative to create a fully immersive experience that transports audiences to another world.

However, it's the cast that truly elevates this film. ""Dune: Part 2"" is a showcase of exceptional acting talent, with each actor delivering performances that are both powerful and nuanced. The characters we've come to know and love in the first film undergo significant evolution, their arcs handled with care and precision. The growth and development of these characters are epic, making their journeys not only believable but also deeply compelling.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is how it deepens the narrative introduced in the first film. The stakes are higher, the conflicts more intense, and the emotions more raw. It's a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, blending action, intrigue, and emotional depth in a way that few films manage to achieve. The screenplay is tight and well-paced, ensuring that every moment feels vital and engaging.

As a fan, I've been waiting for a movie like this for years. ""Dune: Part 2"" is not just a sequel; it's a fulfillment of the promise made by its predecessor. It's a film that not only expands on the world-building of the first part but also delivers the payoff in spectacular fashion. Whether you're a long-time fan of the Dune series or new to this epic saga, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a cinematic journey that you won't want to miss. It's a jewel in modern filmmaking, a testament to what can be achieved when a beloved story is brought to life with passion, skill, and dedication.",dune part surpass predecessor also stand cinemat triumph reminisc return jedi while first instal provid rich context tantal glimps expans univers dune second part truli bring saga life deliv depth drama grandeur fan eagerli anticip from first frame evid dune part visual masterpiec the cinematographi breathtak captur vast intric landscap arraki stun clariti beauti everi scene meticul craft draw viewer deeper stori rich tapestri the special effect equal impress seamlessli blend narr creat fulli immers experi transport audienc anoth world howev cast truli elev film dune part showcas except act talent actor deliv perform power nuanc the charact weve come know love first film undergo signific evolut arc handl care precis the growth develop charact epic make journey believ also deepli compel one strike aspect dune part deepen narr introduc first film the stake higher conflict intens emot raw it film keep edg seat blend action intrigu emot depth way film manag achiev the screenplay tight wellpac ensur everi moment feel vital engag a fan ive wait movi like year dune part sequel fulfil promis made predecessor it film expand worldbuild first part also deliv payoff spectacular fashion whether your longtim fan dune seri new epic saga dune part cinemat journey wont want miss it jewel modern filmmak testament achiev belov stori brought life passion skill dedic

"I'd like to start my review by saying I'm not a Sci Fi fan, I don't ""get"" the genre. But this... Well, this (Dune 1 and 2) completely and utterly shattered that notion.

The cinematography, visuals, soundscapes and music are just so incredible, so far ahead of its time, so magnificent - my brain literally couldn't cope.

I'm actually grateful that dialogue was kept to a minimum because there is just so much to take in and absorb, that dealing with bloated dialogue would have ruined it completely for me.

Instead this film relies on iconic scenes, memorable, heart wrenching sounds, majestic visuals (that leave your jaw dropping) and landscapes that have you thinking ""this cant be real""

I watched it on IMAX but am going back a 2nd time to watch on normal screen in the cinema and have already pre-ordered on Apple TV.

"It's the peak of Hollywood production and yet it's a snoozefest. What happens when you have an overly polished cinematic experience packed with characters that have no real personalities or depth of any kind? You get Dune 1 & 2. I found my self sluggish in my chair falling asleep at multiple points in the movie. The studio must have required a 2 1/2+ hour movie because the movie was packed extremely slow scenes, actual slow-mo scenes, and scenes of landscapes with zero substance. The movie could have easily crammed in 45 minutes if they wanted to. I figured after the first one that it surely couldn't be another sleeper and boy was I wrong. If there's a Dune 3 I'll bring my neck pillow next time.",it peak hollywood product yet snoozefest what happen overli polish cinemat experi pack charact real person depth kind you get dune i found self sluggish chair fall asleep multipl point movi the studio must requir hour movi movi pack extrem slow scene actual slowmo scene scene landscap zero substanc the movi could easili cram minut want i figur first one sure couldnt anoth sleeper boy i wrong if there dune ill bring neck pillow next time

"Hear me out: I love sci-fi, and Denis Villeneuve is very skilled at creating Dune Pt. 1, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival. Now we have Dune Pt. 2, which I just saw in IMAX at an early screening last night. It is, as you might expect, a technical marvel with a stacked cast who all bring their A-game. Like The Two Towers or Empire Strikes Back, it expands on the lore, worldbuilding, develops the main characters and introduces new ones. Most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here. The battle sequences are incredible and creative in places. I think it's safe to say that if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. BUT, it's easier to admire than to love, with the characters at arms' length, even by the time the credits rolled. Keep in mind that while the movie is very good, it still has pacing issues and is too long. In fact, there is so much going on here that it feels like two movies' worth. This is not as great as the hype makes you believe (masterpiece, next LOTR, etc.). But as a sequel to Dune, it works well enough to entertain while suffering from that middle-chapter syndrome that most second chapters do.",hear i love scifi deni villeneuv skill creat dune pt blade runner arriv now dune pt i saw imax earli screen last night it might expect technic marvel stack cast bring agam like the two tower empir strike back expand lore worldbuild develop main charact introduc new one most set stori charact front paid degre the battl sequenc incred creativ place i think safe say like first movi youll like one but easier admir love charact arm length even time credit roll keep mind movi good still pace issu long in fact much go feel like two movi worth thi great hype make believ masterpiec next lotr etc but sequel dune work well enough entertain suffer middlechapt syndrom second chapter
"Another exemplary work of art by Denis Villeneuve. Dune Part 2 is absolutely an Epic Cinema just like Dune Part 1.

This one only should be experienced in a mammoth IMAX 70 MM Screen with Largest and loudest format.

Flawless Visual effects, Such Glorious Cinematography by Greig Fraser, Beautiful production design, The Heart Thumping Astounding Musical score and Sonically Sound design by Hans Zimmer. The background score will stay with you for Days.

The 3 Pillars of these two parts Epic Adventure Films are 'Direction', 'Visuals' and 'Background Score'.

Story, screenplay, Action sequence are excellent.

Denis Villeneuve, Greg Fraser and Hans Zimmer have such mastery towards their work, Direction, Cinematography and Music. What a great Collaboration.

Brilliant performance by every actor. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Stella Skarsgard, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and last but not the least Christopher Walken were Fantastic.

Dune Part 1 and Part 2 will be remembered as most Spectacular Sci-Fi Action, Adventure, War, Drama Films in the history.

"Awarding 10/10s, for me, are given only to the likes of Empire Strikes Back, Return of the King, or Raiders of the Lost Ark .... it truly must be great. So to get to the 10 plateau in my critiques reflects a certain quality and value within my little bubble of love for movies. The recent (say last 7 or 8 years) output from the industry has been worse (much worse) than lack-luster, most of the the ""tent pole block busters"" have been cinematic garbage (see for example, The Marvels and as far back as The Last Jedi, basically most anything from Disney but certainly not exclusive to Disney) .

Here we have a movie created by a team free of the DEI quotas and agenda driven malarkey and they have produced nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!!! Probably the best science fiction movie of the decade, ranking it up there with one of the best sequels ever constructed (if you can call it that ... it feels more like the second half of a very long movie). Every aspect of this movie, from the cinematography, to the directing, writing, acting, CGI, sound, score... it is spot on perfect. The amount of talent that went into this movie shows and the end product is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise decaying industry poisoned by toxic one-sided politics, nearly dead and left to rot. I was truly emotional at the end, tears running down my face, not so much moved by the story (which was excellent) but having finally witnessed a truly great movie after years of absolute garbage, the emotion stirred in me was one of relief, a calming repose that great movie making has not been completely killed off and that it is still possible to make a movie that is not promoting ""the message"" or clubbing me over the head with a bunch of nonsense.",award given like empir strike back return king raider lost ark truli must great so get plateau critiqu reflect certain qualiti valu within littl bubbl love movi the recent say last year output industri wors much wors lacklust tent pole block buster cinemat garbag see exampl the marvel far back the last jedi basic anyth disney certainli exclus disney here movi creat team free dei quota agenda driven malarkey produc noth short cinemat masterpiec probabl best scienc fiction movi decad rank one best sequel ever construct call feel like second half long movi everi aspect movi cinematographi direct write act cgi sound score spot perfect the amount talent went movi show end product breath fresh air otherwis decay industri poison toxic onesid polit nearli dead left rot i truli emot end tear run face much move stori excel final wit truli great movi year absolut garbag emot stir one relief calm repos great movi make complet kill still possibl make movi promot messag club head bunch nonsens
"This is simply stunning in every way. Gorgeous cinematography, exceptional sound, great performances, phenomenal battle scenes, political intrigue and manipulation, religious symbolism, you name it it's there, and all done brilliantly. I enjoyed Part one but this is on entirely different level.

You don't need to have seen part one to enjoy this, it can be viewed as a standalone film in its own right. Of course if you have seen part one some elements will be that much easier to grasp. It's a testament to Villeneuve that he has pulled that off without any flashbacks retelling of anything in part one and make it completely understandable to a new viewer.

Some of the set pieces are astounding, and my internal cheerleader was whooping silently in my head on a number of occasions. On a couple of occasions I resisted the temptation, to stand up and cheer. It's extremely rare for any film to make me feel that way no matter how good.

Timothy Chalamet has never been better, his performance totally befitting the part of Paul.

The studio were right to delay release so the cast could promote it. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience and not just sci-fi fans and the cast and crew should be rightly proud of the achievement, a sold out theatre in the middle of a weekday afternoon tells you everything. If you make a movie as good as this the cinema is the best place to see it. Don't wait see it now.

"Having just experienced ""Dune: Part Two,"" I'm utterly convinced that it stands among the greatest films ever created. Denis Villeneuve has delivered a follow-up that amplifies every breathtaking aspect of its predecessor.

The sheer scope of this movie is awe-inspiring. The world of Arrakis unfolds with such meticulous detail and grand scale that you feel fully immersed in this alien yet starkly beautiful setting. The visual effects are nothing short of mind-blowing; from the majesty of the colossal sandworms to the intricate spectacle of futuristic battles, each frame is a masterclass in cinematic artistry.

But it's not just a visual feast. The story in ""Part Two"" takes a bolder, more complex turn. The political intrigue intensifies, the stakes feel impossibly high, and the depths of Paul Atreides' destiny are plumbed in ways that are both thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. While the film is grand and epic, it skillfully balances spectacle with profound character moments and a plot laden with themes of prophecy, power, and the consequences of choice.

If you were a fan of the first ""Dune,"" prepare to be blown away. If you're a lover of cinema itself, this film is an absolute must-see.",have experienc dune part two im utterli convinc stand among greatest film ever creat deni villeneuv deliv followup amplifi everi breathtak aspect predecessor the sheer scope movi aweinspir the world arraki unfold meticul detail grand scale feel fulli immers alien yet starkli beauti set the visual effect noth short mindblow majesti coloss sandworm intric spectacl futurist battl frame masterclass cinemat artistri but visual feast the stori part two take bolder complex turn the polit intrigu intensifi stake feel imposs high depth paul atreid destini plumb way thrill deepli thoughtprovok while film grand epic skill balanc spectacl profound charact moment plot laden theme propheci power consequ choic if fan first dune prepar blown away if your lover cinema film absolut mustse
"Sorry, but I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews at all, because compared to the original, the desert planet from 1984, this remake unfortunately can't keep up at all, not keep up with the acting performance, not with the science fiction elements, which were already more imaginative and better in 1984 than in the current Vision version, and certainly not with the mysticism that was transported over to the original. The main actor would have been better off in a children's movie epic, but he came across as sympathetic but by no means like a leader. In addition, the intellect lacked physical strength and size. The film, which was performed and presented much too loudly, unfortunately disappointed me all along the line. It is better to enjoy the original.",sorri i cant agre enthusiast review compar origin desert planet remak unfortun cant keep keep act perform scienc fiction element alreadi imagin better current vision version certainli mystic transport origin the main actor would better child movi epic came across sympathet mean like leader in addit intellect lack physic strength size the film perform present much loudli unfortun disappoint along line it better enjoy origin
"Can a sequel surpass the original? YES IT CAN! ""Dune: Part Two"" delivers in so many ways, making this one of the greatest science fiction films ever. With a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, you can easily see that not a single second was wasted. Sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience, feeling every single bit of bass in the seats. Visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography. The cast was phenomenal, providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some Oscar nominations incoming. Especially when it comes to Austin Butler stealing the show taking on the role of Feyd-Rautha, one of the best villain performances in a while. To top that all off, Hans Zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score.

Having loved Dune part 1, went in with high hopes but the movie was a bit slow for my liking. The last act was a bit of a mess with a lot of plot holes and the last fight was underwhelming.

Overall it felt like the movie was the same quality as the first one but with a few misses right at the end. The scenes are amazing and epic, the setting is great and there could have been a bit more humour.

Great acting all around from the stars (as you expect from the heavy hitters) and great to see Timothy mature up in his acting. Austin butler was a standout.",great movi masterpiec have love dune part went high hope movi bit slow like the last act bit mess lot plot hole last fight underwhelm overal felt like movi qualiti first one miss right end the scene amaz epic set great could bit humour great act around star expect heavi hitter great see timothi matur act austin butler standout
"I'm sorry, but despite all the hype, Villeneuve has made just two long boring movies, with flat. Cold characters that never make you get involved or to care for what they are doing. Soundtrack is just a lot of noise trying to overwhelm you, but also extremely boring and often annoying, what a waste, they could have helped to make every scene more moving. It only makes sense for the Harkonnen world, that is supposed to be disgusting. The visuals are quite great for the Harkonnen, obviously drinking from Giger's ideas, which is good, since he was the one involved in Jodorowsky's Dune for this matter. Even the worms are not so impressive and have a flat-worm ""personality"" sorry for the bad joke. I guess CGI is also making everything more flat, grey, and false. I think Javier Bardem's performance is one of the few things that gives a little authenticity to the story. Amazingly enough, I probably would prefer Lynch's Dune, if they released his original 5 hours cut.",im sorri despit hype villeneuv made two long bore movi flat cold charact never make get involv care soundtrack lot nois tri overwhelm also extrem bore often annoy wast could help make everi scene move it make sen harkonnen world suppos disgust the visual quit great harkonnen obvious drink giger idea good sinc one involv jodorowski dune matter even worm impress flatworm person sorri bad joke i guess cgi also make everyth flat grey fals i think javier bardem perform one thing give littl authent stori amazingli enough i probabl would prefer lynch dune releas origin hour cut
"Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and narratively gripping movie that continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in an impressive manner. The film's phenomenal visuals, score, VFX, and acting make the 166-minute runtime feel too little to enjoy fully. For the best experience, I highly recommend watching it in an IMAX theatre.

Denis Villeneuve has done a fantastic job of taking the story from the book and transforming it into an epic second installment of his series. As someone who loved the first movie, I had high expectations, but Villeneuve managed to surpass them all.

"I thought Dune: Part 1 was amazing, but Denis Villeneuve cranked out a masterpiece with Part 2! Every moment was spellbinding, the cinematography epic, the acting authentic, and the world building was astonishing.

They made changes form the book, sure, but the changes they made fit in with the tone of the narrative. Zendaya's Chani is strong yet feminine, and you feel both her growth and her struggle throughout the film. Timothée Chalamet shines as Paul, he conveys a quiet strength throughout the film, and you believe his struggles as well as his ascent to leadership, he earns it and owns it. The rest of the cast brings their best to the film, every character feels well lived-in.

The film is truly visually breathtaking, so many wonderful directing choices. I love that Villeneuve allows us to linger in scenes, to extend the feeling of each world as you visit them. You feel like you have a sense for the Dune universe simply though the visual and sound spaces.

Hollywood, this is what we want. Heroic Masculine and Feminine characters, good writing and pacing, authenticity.

"To see a successor so good that it almost outshine it's predecessor is rare. Last time I saw this happen was with the Dark knight. I don't want it to be another dark knight because I want Dune 3 to ascend even beyond this but the bar is set just too high.

Through the movie characters are given more depth, new ones are introduced there motivations are shown, and yet we cannot simply say who to root for. All characters have their own sets of dynamics and even the simplest of lines in part 1 are given a grand entry in part 2. The visionary director once again succeeded in providing some new breathtaking visuals and too see Hans Zimmer give another great musical is just the cherry on top you need.

Overall it's a great movie and a great successor to Dune 1. The scale is set too high but I know the director will have something new waiting for us in part 3 as well.",to see successor good almost outshin predecessor rare last time i saw happen dark knight i dont want anoth dark knight i want dune ascend even beyond bar set high through movi charact given depth new one introduc motiv shown yet cannot simpli say root all charact set dynam even simplest line part given grand entri part the visionari director succeed provid new breathtak visual see han zimmer give anoth great music cherri top need overal great movi great successor dune the scale set high i know director someth new wait u part well

Food for thought : while watching dune part 2 I realized that this is not entirely a revenge saga, It includes many layers of conflict and different ideologies . But the thing is, the books came out in 1960s , back then these complex stories hardly adapted into movies , only later ""an average revenge flick"" became a thing, To write something of this magnitude is such an astounding feat.",i wasnt awar book dune part came seen dune part amaz see experienc came one imagin year research brain scratch watch film biggest screen possibl food thought watch dune part i realiz entir reveng saga it includ mani layer conflict differ ideolog but thing book came back complex stori hardli adapt movi later averag reveng flick becam thing to write someth magnitud astound feat
"An amazing story telling, camera work just spectacular, storyline true to the book, and those who read the series know how complicated the plot line is, yet the movie managed to convey most of it truthfully, and with not much straying from Herbert's ideas. I went in with very high expectations and I am happy to say they were met. A very long movie, yes, but totally worth seeing. A much better adaptation than 1980 version in my eyes.

But the writing and acting do matter more to me and in the end that's what's makes it a little bit worse than previous movie. Dennis is great director, but don't have your judgement clouded by 10/10 reviews which are overblown and overhyped like in every other holywood movie.

"The film is a masterpiece, flawlessly executed with a meticulous attention to detail, earning a perfect score of 10/10. It defies description; the director demonstrates an unparalleled mastery of his craft. Truly, a magician at work! In my estimation, it stands as the pinnacle of cinematic achievement thus far. I was enveloped in goosebumps from start to finish, particularly when experienced on the grand scale of IMAX or a comparable venue, truly enhancing its immersive qualities as a cinematic spectacle.

"It's been a minute since we've seen big screen, full-meal-deal science fiction, and Dune: Part Two tries to deliver. With sweeping special effects and a very large canvass, this film does its best to check the boxes created when the Star Wars franchise was at its zenith.

But as the CGI glitz and ear-piercing sound fade, what remains is less-than-satisfying dialogue and the shopworn plot lines of ""little guy fights against inestimable odds"" and ""will two lovers find a way?""

Casting is uneven. Rebecca Ferguson's screen-scorching sensuality is barely recognizable and wasted here, but the amiable Austin Butler transforms well from his turn as a sympathy-evoking Elvis into a cheerfully efficient serial killer. Once again, Javier Bardem steals scene after scene with his comically touching portrayal of destiny's true believer.

Despite its flaws, this film still entertains, perhaps because we're so starved for the genre that we're more forgiving than the sand worms.

But truly, if you're going all-in on a mega-production such as Dune Two, give a thought to the screenplay. As theatre attendance strives for a post-COVID comeback, the redefinition of an ""epic"" film will need to include more crisp dialogue and a tighter plot line.",it minut sinc weve seen big screen fullmeald scienc fiction dune part two tri deliv with sweep special effect larg canvas film best check box creat star war franchis zenith but cgi glitz earpierc sound fade remain lessthansatisfi dialogu shopworn plot line littl guy fight inestim odd two lover find way cast uneven rebecca ferguson screenscorch sensual bare recogniz wast amiabl austin butler transform well turn sympathyevok elvi cheer effici serial killer onc javier bardem steal scene scene comic touch portray destini true believ despit flaw film still entertain perhap starv genr forgiv sand worm but truli your go allin megaproduct dune two give thought screenplay a theatr attend strive postcovid comeback redefinit epic film need includ crisp dialogu tighter plot line
"Dune Part 2, continues the story of Paul and his mom as they live on after his family's dissemination. Acclimating with the Desert people, he continues his path to acceptance and revenge whilst her mom, is pushed for deity-ship as the new reverend mother.

Its biggest strength is that it is a visual feast. Every moment is a painting vibe. Deneuve knows how to frame his shot and elegantly present it to the audience.

Personally, not my film though. Its a bit dense for a Dune normie like me. This truly felt like you actually need to watch Dune Part One again and relearn stuff. AND, I hated that this film was written to be more of an actual 2hr 45min interlude to the third film. It was not a film that can stand on its own EVEN with the knowledge you had if you watched the first part.

I also felt that this came off intensely slow (not well paced) and overlong. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact. A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogue.

Overall, just not my cup of tea.

"Dune: Part Two is the best cinematic experience i've ever had. I liked the first part for its cinematography, sound design and introduction of Frank Herbert's version of a Sci-Fi Fantasy. But the second part exceeds in nearly every aspect. Everyone liked Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" for establishing a modern Sci-Fi Fanatsy world but unlike Star Wars for example it was supposed to introduce to the world of Dune from the beginning; apart from the sound- and set-design and the SFX the story was rather simple. Not so ""Dune: Part Two"". The story picks up speed quickly and packs tons of plot in a short time whilst never sacraficing breathtaking and perfectly timed pictures and scenes. The cut is perfect and camera and SFX are even more astonishing than in the first film. The topics this film depicts leave extensive food for thought covering politics, mass manipulation through religion, fate and human behaviour. Personaly I sometimes thought I was presented with a summary of all ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" plots, which is a good thing. Maybe even including the humor; the film is funny at times, not like Marvel, but some may be disturbed by it. Personaly I was not. The only negative I noticed after finishing the film is that the score lacks a recognisable theme, the Arakis-Theme appears one or two times, but the quantity of leitmotifs isn't quite on a Star Wars level. I wouldn't say the film is perfect but rounding up from 9.99 leads me to my final rating of 10 Stars.",dune part two best cinemat experi ive ever i like first part cinematographi sound design introduct frank herbert version scifi fantasi but second part exce nearli everi aspect everyon like deni villeneuv dune establish modern scifi fanatsi world unlik star war exampl suppos introduc world dune begin apart sound setdesign sfx stori rather simpl not dune part two the stori pick speed quickli pack ton plot short time whilst never sacraf breathtak perfectli time pictur scene the cut perfect camera sfx even astonish first film the topic film depict leav extens food thought cover polit mass manipul religion fate human behaviour personali i sometim thought i present summari star war the clone war plot good thing mayb even includ humor film funni time like marvel may disturb personali i the neg i notic finish film score lack recognis theme arakisthem appear one two time quantiti leitmotif isnt quit star war level i wouldnt say film perfect round lead final rate star
"Not a word I use lightly, but for the first time in years I was sat in the cinema and gave no thought to anything other than the film. It absolutely demands your focus and rewards you for supplying it.

Other than leaving you desperately wanting more, there are no negatives to write about.

The positives are myriad. The visual effects, the sound design, the acting, the story. All impeccable. There are so many moments of stress but just as many of triumph. You will experience the catharsis of the characters as intensely as they feel it.

I can't wait for the inevitable supercut that combines this and the first film, as they could have seamlessly blended them into an over 5 hour epic.",not word i use lightli first time year i sat cinema gave thought anyth film it absolut demand focu reward suppli other leav desper want neg write the posit myriad the visual effect sound design act stori all impecc there mani moment stress mani triumph you experi catharsi charact intens feel i cant wait inevit supercut combin first film could seamlessli blend hour epic

"We have been starved and deprived of good quality movies these last couple of years.

Hollywood and its soulless companies like Wokisney have spent billions on box checking, politics, social politics, and other nonsense onto our screens. Only for it to blow up in their faces, listen to your customers and what they want! We want a good story, plot and escape the day-to-day issues.

Thankfully, Dune: Part 2 is here to bring the balance back. No, box ticking, just good acting based on people's ability and to be immersed in a story.

Dune part 2 is excellent, great acting, the complex situation of Paul's path and the politics involved with his choices.

"The immersive experience portrayed before us is exceptional.

Timothée Chalamet giving an unforgettable performance as Paul Atreides / Usul / Muad'Dib. Showcasing a range of emotions and strength, really captivating the audience as we watch the war for freedom of the Fremen whilst avenging his father and House Atreides.

This movie not only meets the standards of the first but surpasses the first movie. With such an overwhelming display of world-building as well as visual sequences. Introducing characters that builds more mystery and hype as the story is being lived before our eyes.

Wondering what is next for the timeline of Dune with Paul Atreides to marry Florence Pugh's Irulan Corrino; leaving many questions such as what direction will Chani and Paul's relationship head as Chani being a concubine and seeing how Paul Atreides character develops.

Watching the line be danced between loyalty and worship where it can be easily swayed to each side.

There is so many aspects that deserves its praise such as the sequence of the sandworm riding and the compositions by Hans Zimmer.

The movie is visually stunning showcasing the world of Arrakis as a sand-filled world mixing beauty with danger as well as the world of Giedi Prime being monochromatic which is a amazing portrayal by Villenueve to obey the direction of the book by sharing the understanding that the ecosystem can hold an influence on its inhabitants. It is gorgeous.

Focusing on the inevitability of fate, the need for sacrifice to progress in the brutal lack of bias in war shown through an obvious passion project for Denis Villenueve and Hans Zimmer who delivered in their sectors without a doubt in this definite Sci-Fi Epic.",the immers experi portray u except timoth chalamet give unforgett perform paul atreid usul muaddib showcas rang emot strength realli captiv audienc watch war freedom fremen whilst aveng father hous atreid thi movi meet standard first surpass first movi with overwhelm display worldbuild well visual sequenc introduc charact build mysteri hype stori live eye wonder next timelin dune paul atreid marri florenc pugh irulan corrino leav mani question direct chani paul relationship head chani concubin see paul atreid charact develop watch line danc loyalti worship easili sway side there mani aspect deserv prais sequenc sandworm ride composit han zimmer the movi visual stun showcas world arraki sandfil world mix beauti danger well world giedi prime monochromat amaz portray villenuev obey direct book share understand ecosystem hold influenc inhabit it gorgeou focus inevit fate need sacrific progress brutal lack bia war shown obviou passion project deni villenuev han zimmer deliv sector without doubt definit scifi epic

"Dune: Part Two continues the epic saga set in the vast and intricate universe crafted by Frank Herbert. Building upon the foundation laid in the first installment, this sequel delves even deeper into the political intrigue, religious undertones, and philosophical complexities that define the Dune universe. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully navigates the narrative, seamlessly blending stunning visuals with profound storytelling. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are as awe-inspiring as ever, evoking a sense of both beauty and danger. Timothée Chalamet reprises his role as Paul Atreides, delivering a nuanced performance that captures the character's inner conflict and burgeoning power. The ensemble cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, each shine in their respective roles, adding depth and dimension to the story. One of the standout aspects of the movie is its exploration of the mystical elements introduced in the first film. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood and their manipulation of bloodlines, the prophetic visions of the Fremen, and the enigmatic nature of the sandworms all contribute to the rich tapestry of the Dune universe. The film also delves deeper into the themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding power. As Paul Atreides grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his family's legacy, he is forced to confront difficult choices that will shape the fate of the galaxy. Villeneuve's direction is both grandiose and intimate, capturing the epic scale of the story while also delving into the personal struggles of its characters. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and visually stunning, but it is the quieter moments of introspection and dialogue that truly resonate. Hans Zimmer's score once again elevates the film, immersing the audience in the world of Dune with its haunting melodies and epic orchestration. Overall, this movie is a triumph of storytelling and spectacle, a worthy continuation of the beloved saga that will leave audiences eagerly awaiting the next chapter. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it solidifies Denis Villeneuve's place as one of the most visionary directors working today.",dune part two continu epic saga set vast intric univers craft frank herbert build upon foundat laid first instal sequel delv even deeper polit intrigu religi underton philosoph complex defin dune univers director deni villeneuv master navig narr seamlessli blend stun visual profound storytel the desert landscap arraki aweinspir ever evok sen beauti danger timoth chalamet repris role paul atreid deliv nuanc perform captur charact inner conflict burgeon power the ensembl cast includ zendaya rebecca ferguson oscar isaac shine respect role ad depth dimens stori one standout aspect movi explor mystic element introduc first film the bene gesserit sisterhood manipul bloodlin prophet vision fremen enigmat natur sandworm contribut rich tapestri dune univers the film also delv deeper theme destini sacrific consequ wield power a paul atreid grappl newfound abil weight famili legaci forc confront difficult choic shape fate galaxi villeneuv direct grandios intim captur epic scale stori also delv person struggl charact the action sequenc pulsepound visual stun quieter moment introspect dialogu truli reson han zimmer score elev film immers audienc world dune haunt melodi epic orchestr overal movi triumph storytel spectacl worthi continu belov saga leav audienc eagerli await next chapter with breathtak visual compel perform thoughtprovok theme solidifi deni villeneuv place one visionari director work today
"Anyone who has read the breathtakingly detailed and dramatically written books by Frank Herbert knows that every film would need minimum 24 hours of running time.

But to integrate Herbert's language of the Fremen ""Chakobsa"", to put all the love the producers and all their teams and characters invested in the details creating this breathtaking movie is rare and best of. That Frank Herbert's son is co producer, represents the deep believe in that epic theme-movie project.

Not to forget the spectacular soundtrack.

"If you hated dune 1 because it was boring, this movie makes it interesting. Every scene is action packed with tangible pay offs that give you an ""OHHHH"" moment. It does justice to the original work, making effective changes that help both onscreen adaption and modernizing the themes. If you liked the first or the books it is absolutely a must see.

Even if you haven't watched dune 1, this movie is incredible. I came in knowing nothing of the dune lore. I didn't even know who Paul was. I am a fan of well done world building and explosions and this movie delivered. The plot is simple allowing any viewer to jump in and become immersed in the world of dune. The themes are easy to engage with but not gratuitous. Every character captures your attention within seconds on screen. I was drooling over the costumes. The acting is incredible as well, not a single complaint to be had.

I had a hard time deciphering what was practical and CGI. Everything looks incredible! By far the best set design ever put on screen. It gets a little long but youre so enthralled it doesn't even matter. Even the theoretical baby stuff is digestible and makes the story all the more interesting.

"This is my first review I've ever written. I've never been compelled enough by ANY film before to share my thoughts.

I've seen so many attempts at portraying moral ambiguity and painting characters in shades of gray, but they always ended up looking flat, and ultimately me not caring about them. For the first time someone managed to tell a gray story, and make it thrilling. I ended up rooting for Paul, and hating myself every second for doing so. Beautiful.

Ultimately, what this film chooses not to say is the most powerful. And amongst the epic battle scenes, the moments of silence are what truly captured me.",thi first review ive ever written ive never compel enough ani film share thought ive seen mani attempt portray moral ambigu paint charact shade gray alway end look flat ultim care for first time someon manag tell gray stori make thrill i end root paul hate everi second beauti ultim film choos say power and amongst epic battl scene moment silenc truli captur
"Truly amazing. I have no words. It was the sequel that not only we so deeply wanted, but also desperately needed. It follows a journey of discovery, power, the rising of a true leader.

"DUNE PART 2 GAVE ME A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE

Now I previously had a similar experience with Dune part one, but Dune part two has taken things to a whole other level.

I am struggling to put into words how incredible Dune Part Two was. I have never before seen a movie that has managed to make me feel this way. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack transported me into another realm. I seriously cannot understate how incredible this soundtrack was, throughout the entire film it was giving me chills. The cinematography, acting, script, was absolutely ruthless. Timothee Chalamet's performance was brutal, and incredibly depicted Paul's fury, and ascent to power. The wide panning shots of the desert coupled with Hans Zimmer's orchestra was breathtaking. The almost rhythmic battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens was phenomenal. This is a movie that not only respects the source material and the scifi genre, but that creates an almost religious lens through which to experience simultaneously the multifaceted complexities of story telling through film, and of the Dune saga. I cannot put into words the complete and utter state of awe I am in right now after coming out of that cinema, I genuinely felt like I just had a spiritual experience and I am not nor have I ever been a spiritual or religious person.",dune part gave me a spiritu experi now i previous similar experi dune part one dune part two taken thing whole level i struggl put word incred dune part two i never seen movi manag make feel way han zimmer soundtrack transport anoth realm i serious cannot underst incred soundtrack throughout entir film give chill the cinematographi act script absolut ruthless timothe chalamet perform brutal incred depict paul furi ascent power the wide pan shot desert coupl han zimmer orchestra breathtak the almost rhythmic battl fremen harkonnen phenomen thi movi respect sourc materi scifi genr creat almost religi len experi simultan multifacet complex stori tell film dune saga i cannot put word complet utter state awe i right come cinema i genuin felt like i spiritu experi i i ever spiritu religi person
"Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timothée Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timothée Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.",dune part two sequel first dune film director deni villeneuv releas paul atreid timoth chalamet join fremen group here tri learn custom handl sandworm paul seek reveng conspir destroy famili with chani zendaya side paul goe battl enemi troop serv emperor christoph walken thi sequel three year later immedi pick first part end thi first part well receiv improv start film adapt dune stori previou film adapt turn less well stori dune book quit larg complic stori with deni villeneuv first part manag properli introduc dune world build polit struggl differ group with second film focus custom belief fremen group think defeat enemi religi approach furthermor relationship paul chani also develop bit rush moment howev second part mani thing explain built upon mean longwind moment second part compar first part second part room action scene increas pace tension slightli furthermor remain polit battl differ group hous fight strateg realli physic in contrast first part thing second part feel rush like relationship paul chani the aspect earthworm fremen handl ride creatur also explain somewhat hasti manner alway clear deni villeneuv provid beauti visual imag differ world area dune book togeth photographi director greig fraser ensur imag appear beauti creativ credibl by adapt dune stori first book seri two film deni villeneuv given cast member space make someth good beauti film adapt thi also give actor space develop charact evolv time get film timoth chalamet thu given opportun develop charact explor newcom someon tri aveng harm done famili furthermor tri savior differ group tri get back balanc compar first part zendaya given time space second part develop charact work chemistri relationship timoth chalamet charact howev relationship seem bit rush mean cannot alway remain believ everi viewer of new cast member austin butler steal scene danger warrior enemi armi charact could given littl time develop other wellknown actor josh brolin florenc pugh christoph walken play role well appropri unfortun major role second dune film
"The film is amazing on the big screen, the score definitely fits the film, BUT the storyline is very distorted and far from what Frank Herbert wrote. The timeline is not supposed to be within a year, and I fear that the next film will move even further away from Dune the messiah now that the timelines have all been put out of place.

The build up to the end was great, but the final battle was over so quickly I was frankly very surprised and extremely disappointed.

The book had subtle twists that were left out of the film and therefore the character development is shallow and the love story between Paul and Chani is left wanting.

Personally I think Florence would have played a better and stronger Chani.

Very disappointed that Alia's birth storyline was completely missed .

They have an amazing casting, and thrown a lot of money into making a sorrowful adaptation of a great book.",the film amaz big screen score definit fit film but storylin distort far frank herbert wrote the timelin suppos within year i fear next film move even away dune messiah timelin put place the build end great final battl quickli i frankli surpris extrem disappoint the book subtl twist left film therefor charact develop shallow love stori paul chani left want person i think florenc would play better stronger chani veri disappoint alia birth storylin complet miss they amaz cast thrown lot money make sorrow adapt great book
"Dune Part 2 is an absolute marvel of a movie, and Zendaya's performance as Chani is just magical. She brings such depth and emotion to the character, making Chani feel like a real person you can root for and connect with. Her chemistry with Timothée Chalamet is off the charts, and you can feel the tension and tenderness between them in every scene they share.

Zendaya's presence on screen is captivating, and you can't help but be drawn into her world. She's not just an actress playing a role; she becomes Chani, embodying her strength, courage, and vulnerability in a way that's truly inspiring.

And let's not forget the rest of the movie - the visuals, the storytelling, everything is just top-notch. Director Denis Villeneuve has created a breathtaking world that feels both epic and intimate, and Zendaya's performance is a shining beacon in the midst of it all.

Overall, Dune Part 2 is a cinematic experience you won't soon forget, and Zendaya's talent and charisma only add to its brilliance. She's truly one of the brightest stars in Hollywood right now, and I can't wait to see what she does next.",dune part absolut marvel movi zendaya perform chani magic she bring depth emot charact make chani feel like real person root connect her chemistri timoth chalamet chart feel tension tender everi scene share zendaya presenc screen captiv cant help drawn world she actress play role becom chani embodi strength courag vulner way that truli inspir and let forget rest movi visual storytel everyth topnotch director deni villeneuv creat breathtak world feel epic intim zendaya perform shine beacon midst overal dune part cinemat experi wont soon forget zendaya talent charisma add brillianc she truli one brightest star hollywood right i cant wait see next
"This movie is officially the new bar by which sci-fi is measured. It is well written executed, acted, and plotted. I am not sure there is a sci-fi epic that approaches this, the closest may be 2001 a space Odyssey or blade runner 2049, but even then this is a step apart and in its own league. If you haven't seen it you must go see it.

This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having.

"Dune: Part Two absolutely blew me away! For years, I thought adapting Frank Herbert's masterpiece was a fool's errand. But then Denis Villeneuve stepped in, and let me tell you, the man's a visionary. He's a master world-builder, and the one he's created for Dune is simply unparalleled. Every detail, from the harsh beauty of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, feels meticulously crafted and utterly believable. The casting is spot-on too; each actor embodies their character perfectly, bringing depth and nuance to even the most minor roles. And let's not forget the action! The explosions are heart-stoppingly real, the fight choreography is top-notch, and every battle sequence is a visceral thrill ride. Dune: Part Two is a masterclass in filmmaking, a rich and immersive experience that leaves you wanting desperately for more.

"Dune: Part Two - A Review (Spoiler-Free)

Here's a spoiler-free review of Dune: Part Two:

Visually Stunning: The film continues the breathtaking visuals from Part One, immersing audiences in the vast landscapes of Arrakis and the grandeur of its cultures. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision shines through, creating a visually stunning experience.

Deeper Exploration: Part Two delves deeper into the complex world of Dune, exploring the Fremen culture and their struggles against the oppressive Harkonnens. It also delves further into Paul Atreides' journey and the burdens of his potential future.

Stronger Focus on Characters: The relationships between characters, particularly Paul and Chani, are given more focus in this film. The performances, especially from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, are powerful and captivating.

Action-Packed Sequences: While not an action-heavy film, Part Two delivers intense and well-choreographed action sequences, particularly when the Fremen face off against their enemies.

Not a Standalone Film: It's important to note that Part Two is the second half of a larger story. While it builds on the first film and offers a satisfying conclusion to its specific arc, it also sets the stage for a potential third film.

Overall: Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and narratively engaging film that builds upon the foundation laid by Part One. It offers a deeper exploration of the characters and world while delivering both action and emotional resonance.

"Dune 2 is a rare gem of a film, in that it accomplishes to expand upon the immense scale of its predecessor, while also giving us a truly intimate connection with the trials of the characters within it. It's a technological marvel, breathing a much needed breath of fresh air to an industry that's been drowning in bloated budget action movies that fail to offer more than tired trends and tropes.

The sound design alone left me with goosebumps at times, hearing sounds that had textures I never knew were possible in cinema. It makes me hopefully for the future of the art that is cinema.

I left the theater feeling as I did as a kid, as if I had just witnessed something truly awe inspiring.",dune rare gem film accomplish expand upon immens scale predecessor also give u truli intim connect trial charact within it technolog marvel breath much need breath fresh air industri that drown bloat budget action movi fail offer tire trend trope the sound design alon left goosebump time hear sound textur i never knew possibl cinema it make hope futur art cinema i left theater feel i kid i wit someth truli awe inspir
"Damn you Motion Picture Academy. I had pledged not to spend one more minute of my life watching ""Dune"" after the first interminable installment, and you go and nominate part 2 for Best Picture.

Here we are again, in the no-humor no man's land where everything is brown when it's not gray, and everyone seriously needs to lighten up. Though you know what? Part 2 is better than part 1, or at least it is for a while. All of the endless exposition that dragged down the first part has already been taken care of, so this one can jump right into some action set pieces, which are admittedly very impressive. But uh oh....mid way through this movie we get more plot which needs....you guessed it....more exposition, and here's me mentally going ""yada yada yada"" and doing that thing with your hand where you open and close it really fast like a blabbering mouth.

I can take Timothee Chalamet seriously when he's brooding and whispering and looking like an angst-filled teen, but I can't take him seriously when he starts yelling and decides to lead a race of people. And I REALLY can't take Austin Butler seriously. He sounds ridiculous, and why is everything on his planet black and white when people go outside but in color when they stay indoors?

""Dune's"" biggest problem is that it doesn't have an entry point that allows a viewer to get past all the sci-fi mumbo jumbo and connect to its story. There's no sense of adventure, or whimsy, or fun. It's all very niche and specific, and though Denis Villaneuve does do some amazing world building, it's a world that leaves me out in the cold. I didn't feel one single emotion while watching this movie.

But whatever. This movie doesn't really need me to like it if its box office and rabid fan base are any indication, so I'll leave love of this franchise to the Dunies and go take myself out to lunch.

"From the music to the acting, directing, the way it's shot, the writing, the special effects everything about dune 2 is perfect. The best experience I have ever had in a cinema was watching this movie. It is easily the best movie of the 2020s so far. In a time where most movies look cheap, have poor acting, writing and directing dune 2 shines as an example of what a movie can be. After watching it for the first time I found myself completely obsessed for a long time. Pauls actions as many people point out are morally questionable, but he is extremely entertaining to watch. Austin Butler as Feud Rautha is an absolute scene stealer. He like everyone else in the movie delivers a fenomenal performance, more than that, he was probably the best in the whole movie.

"After watching Dune 2 in the theaters last night, I can ensure that this is the ultimate culmination of Denis Villeneuve's vision for Dune. He can improve upon his previous masterpiece of the first Dune movie in 2021 tenfold. Each shot, each frame is pure artistry. It truly highlights the breadth of the vastness of the desert and mythical culture of Dune. From the desert sunsets in the sky to the fierce fighting sequences in the sands, each scene is a one of amazing magnitude. And the visual effects for every sandworm, ship, and every single aspect is one of master quality. Each sand worm and ornithopter feels so realistic and tangible, like I am watching a real-life documentary than a sci fi film. This is especially important given all the CGI complaints over the past year and a half. But rest assure, the visual effects for Dune are all beautifully painstakingly created and are sheer works of craftsmanship.",after watch dune theater last night i ensur ultim culmin deni villeneuv vision dune he improv upon previou masterpiec first dune movi tenfold each shot frame pure artistri it truli highlight breadth vast desert mythic cultur dune from desert sunset sky fierc fight sequenc sand scene one amaz magnitud and visual effect everi sandworm ship everi singl aspect one master qualiti each sand worm ornithopt feel realist tangibl like i watch reallif documentari sci fi film thi especi import given cgi complaint past year half but rest assur visual effect dune beauti painstakingli creat sheer work craftsmanship
"Not only is this movie absolutely masterful at everything it does, it also makes Dune Part One stand out. As someone who doesn't know the original novel, the Dune hype never truly met me when it came out. Sure. Acting, cinematography, visuals, soundtrack by Hanz Zimmer, everything at its peak. But the most important and my favorite part, the lore and story, were clouded in mist. Didn't understand a single thing, jumping from different parts of the story didn't help.

Characters I never knew interacted with world I never knew, politics of factions I never heard of, it just came down too quickly and with little to explain.

I saw ""Dune - Part 2"" ... This movie is the Dark Knight, Terminator 2, Spiderman 2, Two Towers... This is the movie that elevates its predecessor to heavens by simply existing. The lore, characters, the prophecy, everything suddenly makes sense. You watch Dune - Part One and you finally understand all those quick shots into Paul's head, what is happening.

"This movie is a huge step-up to the first instalment. It is the very movie the cinema industry needs at this current slum in film quality.

Take Madame Web, for example. A result of poor production and corrupt admin. The movie is worse than horrible because it's been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move on.

Dune is quite literally the complete opposite of this. The developers have a deep connection to the source material, and their devotion is crystal clear.

Dune: Part 2 is a culmination of hard work, dedication, commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure. There are no points in this movie where one may 'fall asleep' which was where the first movie fell off.

The way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves, making them feel like they are within the world of Dune itself, watching events play out as a warrior along Paul's side or one of his religious fanatics.

The movie, in most senses, actually moves TOO fast - which may hurt the interpretation of what's presented (because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eye-candy structure of most current action films). But, nonetheless, if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand, you probably will.

On a side note, this movie couldn't have achieved what it has without its predecessor. Many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience, but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first film.

One last point, this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and CGI.

This film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact. It would not have been as jaw-dropping without Hanz Zimmer's S-tier performance and love of composition - should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the film's universe to produce such fitting and unique sound?

Additionally, this film stands as a manual on how to properly use CGI and stage control. It goes against the current methods of using animation to please the eye, and yet, showed us things more stunning and impactful than the poorly rendered scenes presented by studios such as Marvel and Sony that everyone seems to appreciate way too much.

"I will not go into spoilers, but I watched this yesterday; I thought the cinematography and to choreography were brilliant. The lack of non diegetic sounds in some scenes made for very tense engagements between characters. I would seriously recommend this to any sci fi enjoyers, as well as anyone interested in impactful film making. It should be said that the performance of actors was also impeccable, I think this may be Chalamet's greatest area for acting yet. I will also add my personal liking to the visuals of the desert settings, however, the choice to alter the lighting to monochromatic in once certain sequence (I will not refer to it to avoid spoilers but you will probably understand upon watching the film) was simply outstanding and provides us to a completely different lifestyle and aesthetic to a different society within the greatly expansive narrative of Dune.",i go spoiler i watch yesterday i thought cinematographi choreographi brilliant the lack non dieget sound scene made ten engag charact i would serious recommend sci fi enjoy well anyon interest impact film make it said perform actor also impecc i think may chalamet greatest area act yet i also add person like visual desert set howev choic alter light monochromat certain sequenc i refer avoid spoiler probabl understand upon watch film simpli outstand provid u complet differ lifestyl aesthet differ societi within greatli expans narr dune

"Dune: Part 2: Review:

""Charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: 'May be dangerous to your health.'"" - Frank Herbert

In ""Dune: Part 2,"" this sentiment finds vivid expression in a cinematic spectacle that parallels the grandeur of iconic sequels like The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this installment delves deeper into the complexities of power, prophecy, and the perilous nature of heroism.

The narrative resumes just after the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis, orchestrated by the secret machinations of Emperor Shaddam IV and House Harkonnen. Despite the devastation, Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica manage to escape, finding refuge among the native Fremen. The Fremen, believing in the prophecy of a savior known as Lisan Al Gaib, come to see Paul as their potential messiah. However, as Paul seeks to rally the Fremen for revenge against the Emperor and House Harkonnen, questions arise about his true nature and destiny.

Director Denis Villeneuve's masterful execution elevates every aspect of the film, from the breathtaking visuals to the nuanced performances. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is a mesmerizing blend of vulnerability and authority, while Zendaya's Chani serves as a poignant anchor amidst the turmoil. The chemistry between them adds depth to their star-crossed romance, enriching the emotional beats of the story.

The supporting cast delivers standout performances, with Javier Bardem's Stillgar providing moments of levity amid the tension. Bardem's portrayal infuses the character with a blend of wisdom and humor. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen emerges as a chilling antagonist, his off-the-rails psychosis portrayed with chilling authenticity. The hand-to-hand combat scene between Rautha and Paul, though brief, is a testament to Butler's prowess as an actor and the film's meticulous choreography. Also Rebecca Fergusion as Jessica, Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen and Batista as Rabban Harkonnen deliver incredible performances.

The film's exploration of religious fundamentalism adds another layer of complexity to its narrative. As Stillgar fervently believes in Paul's divine role as the savior, and the Bene Gesserit manipulate prophecies to serve their own agenda, the dangers of blind faith and fanaticism are laid bare. Villeneuve's deft handling of these themes adds depth and urgency to the story, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of belief and its consequences.

Greg Fraser's cinematography deserves special mention for its stunning visuals, which capture the vast and treacherous landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty. Moments like Paul's first ride atop a majestic Shai Hulud are a sight to behold, showcasing Fraser's mastery in bringing the world of Dune to life on the screen.

Dune is incomplete without its music, scored masterfully by Hans Zimmer. He has given uncountable iconic themes in the past and yet he manages to score another gem which will surely become the new benchmark for such out-wordly adventure movies.

""Dune: Part 2"" is not merely a spectacle; it is a dark and dense story that demands the viewer's full attention. To fully appreciate this movie, viewers must watch Part 1 and pay close attention to every word spoken on screen. This is not a film to be taken lightly; it is an immersive experience that rewards careful observation and reflection.

One of the most goosebumps-inducing moments comes when Timothée Chalamet's Paul Muad'dib Usul Atreides uses the Voice with chilling authority, screaming 'Silence' to a character. It's a testament to Chalamet's commanding presence.

Christopher Nolan must count his lucky stars that ""Dune: Part 2"" faced delays, allowing his film ""Oppenheimer"" to shine during the awards season. Villeneuve's masterpiece would have undoubtedly overshadowed many contenders with its unparalleled grandeur and depth, solidifying Villenueve's status as a true sci-fi genius.

Dune Part 2 is Monumental, Malevolent and Captivating, a true sci-fi movie of a Generation. ""Long live the Fighters"".

"This movie was probably one of all time best movie I've seen!!

A had high hopes for this movie and still it succeeded to be better than I expected.

Saw it just yesterday in the cinema and took my wife with me that usually doesn't like these kind of movies but she really loved it.

And she told me that now she needs to she the first Dune movie and number 3 when it comes out. Only that tells me how good it is.

I would though recommend to watch on a good tv with good sound system.

My take on the movie is just that it hits all of the things you wanna see in a SCI-FI movie.

So if you are a SCI-FI fan this movie will not disappoint you!

For me it's the best movie of the decade, if not the best movie of all time!!! The score is incredible, every sound effect makes the movie epic, and the score for me is one of the things that makes this movie so good aswell.

Do not watch this movie if you are the least bit drowsy, I can assure you that you'll definitely fall asleep.

"A sci fi epic. The plot is immersive, the story moves at pace; I was hooked on the old as well as the new characterisations, Austin Butler is sinister! This was an enthralling visual experience with amazing scenery, costumes and a distinctive orange filter making the desert landscapes and scenes ethereal. The soundtrack was thundering and embellished every scene throughout. Glad I watched part 1 again before this and I'll be seeing this for a second time tomorrow.

Battle scenes are hectic, the low camera keeps you tight into the action. The style infused into part 1 & 2 are the same, but the tone has changed. Now it's about vengeance and victory. Religion, politics, power and romance what a mix.

"I went to go see Dune yesterday on a whim at an Immersive IMAX big screen theater although I usually just view movies in regular theaters I am delighted of my experience.

It was a breathtaking must see experience, all of the cinematography was beautiful & captivating.

The universe felt alive & realistic partly because it wasn't committing the grave story telling Sin of attempting to ""tell"" rather than ""show"" as a lot of modern stories do when there's a massive expansive universe to cover in the film format.

Dune was filled with breath taking cinematography and sounds that would take you on the edge of your seat as you felt your body reacting to it as if you were in the world yourself.

Dune Part II is true art, in Logos, Pathos, and Ethos.

It all makes clear logical sense both in the narrative, the characters's thoughts, decisions, feelings, behavior & actions.

It evokes a strong emotional response and puts tension in the viewer's seat.

It clearly portrays the themes of religious beliefs in a fair ethical manner without insulting either the faithful or the faith less's intelligence or trying to tell them what to believe ... merely shows how all of the beings in the Dune universe come to their faith & explores themes of why humans have / need faith in the face of suffering or adversity.

As it is said, all human beings were created to worship something and if nots not a messiah or some God or divine entity it will be other things like ""Spice"" for instance or power or a dictator or sex, money, love, themselves & being trapped in self centric thinking of the Ego & Prideful mind, etc

I will be thinking about this movie for days, and will watch it again several more times. The last time a movie blew my mind like this was when the first Avatar came out in theaters, or the Dark Knight, or Braveheart. This movie ranks at the top of the list of the best movies of all time.

"Dune is my favorite novel of all time. I love it so much that David Lynch's version is enjoyable because of its incomprehensibility.

I might be biased when I say Denis Villeneuve is probably the best modern director but i've thought that long before even Dune Part 1. Sicario was my first foray into his territory and it was astoundingly brilliant. Arrival and Blade Runner '49 both stuck with me for months. Dune Pt 1 set my expectations high.

Pt 2 sticks that landing and then some. I wanted to see it again THE DAY after i saw it. Its epic, beautiful, well paced, and surprisingly funny. Its not that Marvel humor, its little jabs here and there that are a chuckle to add levity.

Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is the standout character, being just unpredictably gruesome and loathsome and his pitch perfect imitation of Stellan Skarsgaard's voice for the Baron.",dune favorit novel time i love much david lynch version enjoy incomprehens i might bias i say deni villeneuv probabl best modern director ive thought long even dune part sicario first foray territori astoundingli brilliant arriv blade runner stuck month dune pt set expect high pt stick land i want see the day saw it epic beauti well pace surprisingli funni it marvel humor littl jab chuckl add leviti austin butler feydrautha standout charact unpredict gruesom loathsom pitch perfect imit stellan skarsgaard voic baron

"Although today, without having reviewed it, I am aware that it was not like that, during my childhood it seemed to me that dozens of years passed between installments 4 and 5 of Harry Potter, this because with the economy as limited as it can be Having a child of approximately 10 years old, I raised money to purchase the first trilogy of the saga and a godmother gave me the fourth film when it was just released. Without exaggeration, I saw those movies hundreds of times, without fear of being wrong I could say that I know them almost by heart from so many days I saw them. I never took into account the future releases that were coming and when I learned of their existence, my excitement and my love for cinema began to flourish.

That's exactly what I want to do with Dune and Dune: Part Two, I want to watch them again and again and again until I wear out the digital copy on Max or whatever platform they're going to be released on in a few months. I want all my friends and people close to me to see them so I can talk about them and understand things that I may not have even paid attention to at first.

I was simply delighted with everything this film gave us, technical aspects, story, script, acting, etc. But as always, mainly when I tell the story of Paul Atreides and how well it is told, I have nothing more to say than praise for the production.

Both times this film evoked strong emotions. At the risk of displaying recency bias, I feel comfortable putting this film in my top 10 films of all time.

"When we think of a ""cinematic experience"" this movie is exactly what I think we mean. It's exactly the sort of filmmaking that cinemas are made for. From set design to special effects, fight choreography, wardrobe, cinematography, direction, acting, screenwriting, you name it and this film delivers an A.

We have been so oversaturated with bland, uninspired, and creatively bankrupt films over the last number of years that going to the cinema has lost much of the excitement that used to surround a trip to the movies. The confidence we used to have that studios and directors were going to at least attempt to deliver to us creatively rich films that engaged us as audience in more ways than simple entertainment is all but gone. But, Dune: Part Two is a return to such films and hopefully a reminder to the rest of Hollywood that this is not only what we desire to see at the movies, but what we expect.

From my perspective, a film moves from entertainment to art when it causes you to reflect on its story, themes, and the world it invites you to participate in beyond its runtime. When you find yourself reflecting on a film hours and even days after you've seen it, then it's possible you've viewed a work of art. Director Denis Villenueve has done that, made a work of art.

Come for the sandworms, the sci-fi action, and stunning visuals of the world of Dune. Stay for a beautifully told human story of power and who we are willing to be in order to attain it, and even more profoundly, who we inevitably become once we have it.",when think cinemat experi movi exactli i think mean it exactli sort filmmak cinema made from set design special effect fight choreographi wardrob cinematographi direct act screenwrit name film deliv a we oversatur bland uninspir creativ bankrupt film last number year go cinema lost much excit use surround trip movi the confid use studio director go least attempt deliv u creativ rich film engag u audienc way simpl entertain gone but dune part two return film hope remind rest hollywood desir see movi expect from perspect film move entertain art caus reflect stori theme world invit particip beyond runtim when find reflect film hour even day youv seen possibl youv view work art director deni villenuev done made work art come sandworm scifi action stun visual world dune stay beauti told human stori power will order attain even profoundli inevit becom

After being a little disappointed by the first one with it feeling to be quite slow paced and jagged this has changed my mind considerably with the series and the ending gives a great opportunity to a third which of course was obvious with how much of the story still hasn't been told from the books.

Since I agree with most of the themes of the books including the relevance of ecology to the current global narrative, I played my small role in promoting this movie by buying admission.

Denis Villeneuve and his team continue to push the boundaries of sci-fi cinema. I was especially impressed with the mobius-ish neo-noir stylistic elements which pays homage to the history of sci-fi and the visual novelty of large anti-gravity machinery and the Sardaukar.

"One of the Greatest Films of this Decade so far In many aspects of cinema this film exceeds.

The cinematography, acting, music, production design, editing, directing and more are all worthy of an Academy Award Nomination if not a win.

Seeing this in True 1.43 aspect ratio IMAX Laser at Boeing Pacific Science Center in Seattle was one the most breathtaking cinema experiences I have ever had.

The cast is stellar, and Greg Frasier's cinematography is again magnificent. Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya did a very good job as Paul and Chani as did the other cast. It gets better when Paul really kicks it in in the 3rd act. Rebecca Ferguson did a very good job as Jessica and stands out.

The comedic relief from Javier Bardem's Stilgar is enjoyable. I know there are mixed feelings about Christopher Walkens Emperor but he did a fine job but didn't do anything special, he was just there.

Where this movie suffers is the dreadful pace. The first two thirds of the movie drag on, despite stuffing what was two years in the book to a couple months in the movie. This does lead to the ending feeling rushed.

Dune: Part Two is an amazing cinematic achievement, and definitely one of the best films of the but I would not at all deem it as one of the greatest sequels of all time or compare it to The Dark Knight or The Empire Strikes Back.

"I watched the movie in cinema and while it was in no way a bad movie I ended up disappointed because according to the current rating of 9.0 I can definitely say it is overrated. I have enjoy the first part more.

The problem I have with the movie is that despite its length it seems to be cramming too many events into the movie and you have a feeling you are constantly skipping ahead from one point to the next without the proper buildup to achieve the significance of some key events which on the other hand is interesting considering the length of the movie. There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate. Napoleon movie for example had this exact same issue for me.

Main character also has many ""Looking cool walking, doing nothing important"" scenes that I am not a fan of.

"This film will go down in history as one of the best sci fi films of all time. Every thread and aspect of this film is finely woven and well inspected and it works like a roaring, beastly, powerful machine. The music and visuals work in such stunning synchronicity, Hans Zimmer was really the only man for the job. Don't go into the film having already listened to the music to help the breathtaking experience. Villeneuve has given himself an impossible job: making Dune Messiah stand up to this film. I'm sure it's possible, Villeneuve has proved time and time again to be one of the most powerful filmmakers of his generation.",thi film go histori one best sci fi film time everi thread aspect film fine woven well inspect work like roar beastli power machin the music visual work stun synchron han zimmer realli man job dont go film alreadi listen music help breathtak experi villeneuv given imposs job make dune messiah stand film im sure possibl villeneuv prove time time one power filmmak gener
"When one's destiny is to rule their people, one won't quit until it has been achieved.

That's what Paul Atreides, played by Timothee Chalamet, must decide in this two part epic that is still unfolding with another part of the soon to be trilogy on its way.

Picking up immediately from the 2021 film, the suspense heightens quickly and does not hold anything back. With the camera mainly focusing on far and wide shots in the dense and humid environment of the dunes, rushes of adrenaline will hit you hard as you watch the sequences unfold in the opening scenes. The director, Denis Villeneuve, stepped up his game from the first film to truly capture the movement and living qualities of the characters in the desert.

The film doesn't waste your time by reintroducing everything but rather expects you to know what happened previously as this is basically their version of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK within the soon to be trilogy. The main subject that stood out to me throughout the film was character growth. Most characters go through change or experience changes around them, some more than others, further enhancing their capabilities and raising the bar for how far they reached to achieve their goals. The character that I thought experienced the most changes was Paul Atreides.

Paul Atriedes slowly made his way up the ladder, from doubting himself for following in his father's footsteps, to coming to his own terms and realizing the true potential he has. By breaking away from his original idea of being his father's predecessor, Paul now realizes that he can do so much more. Paul's growth from the first film to this one was immense and important. Once a self-judging and insecure person to someone who has everyone looking up to him, not just as a leader but a savior, is noteworthy in and of itself. With every good leader or religious figure there is always one downside or trait that follows them and for Paul, it's his desperate hunger for power. The further he goes on the path he's following, for everything good he's committing to, he slowly loses himself in a power hungry struggle.

Florence Pugh's performance in the film, although quite small, is all encompassing, as it should be since she is the daughter of the emperor after all. Pugh gives off a strong sense of empowerment that I think the emperor, played by Christopher Walken, didn't quite have on screen. Having a high status on her shoulders, she also carried the slightest hint of worry, never knowing what could happen between her father and her people. She also brings a lot of emotional weight when it comes to her facial expressions as she's able to say so much without speaking. From the shock she gives off to the short but sweet smiles, it all makes for a more dramatic but beautiful look for the film.

Austin Butler's performance in the film is quite a suspenseful one. Not only is he another new addition to the already large list of characters, he brings a vibe like no other. When we first meet his character, the color grading changes from vibrant and bright to a black and white scheme, giving off a sinister look to his character and many others. I previously mentioned facial expressions and how Florence Pugh did an excellent job yet it is Austin Butler, however who takes it above and beyond everyone's expectations. The way he brought some of his sinister expressions had the same effect as Azog did from THE HOBBIT trilogy of films, especially when he was a fully CG rendered character. I personally think he outperformed Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard, who were in the same boat as him, playing another role as members of the family.

Timothee Chalamet's performance in this film is a far step ahead from where he was originally in the first film, truly showing what he's capable of as an actor and this is most evident towards the later acts of the film. Chalamet brings a lot of charm to the role as Paul, allowing the audience to connect with him as he taps into a leadership role which the audience may be able to relate to if they have had to be a leader in their lives. Chalamet takes the emotional status that Paul has from the first film to a whole new level in this second film. Having previously had more of a laid back focus to his character, even though he's the heart of both films, he pushed the limits this time as he breaks that barrier and becomes the leader he was meant to be.

At the end of the day, DUNE: PART TWO is a phenomenal piece of cinema that we don't get all that often. To see this film on the big screen, even if it's not on IMAX, is still a beauty of a film to look at, thanks to Greig Fraser, the cinematographer. Would I recommend this film to the general audience? No, as it is a slow burner, mainly focusing on heavy character development, but when it comes to pure film lovers, this shouldn't be overlooked.",when one destini rule peopl one wont quit achiev that paul atreid play timothe chalamet must decid two part epic still unfold anoth part soon trilog way pick immedi film suspens heighten quickli hold anyth back with camera mainli focus far wide shot den humid environ dune rush adrenalin hit hard watch sequenc unfold open scene the director deni villeneuv step game first film truli captur movement live qualiti charact desert the film doesnt wast time reintroduc everyth rather expect know happen previous basic version the empir strike back within soon trilog the main subject stood throughout film charact growth most charact go chang experi chang around other enhanc capabl rais bar far reach achiev goal the charact i thought experienc chang paul atreid paul atried slowli made way ladder doubt follow father footstep come term realiz true potenti by break away origin idea father predecessor paul realiz much paul growth first film one immens import onc selfjudg insecur person someon everyon look leader savior noteworthi with everi good leader religi figur alway one downsid trait follow paul desper hunger power the goe path he follow everyth good he commit slowli lose power hungri struggl florenc pugh perform film although quit small encompass sinc daughter emperor pugh give strong sen empower i think emperor play christoph walken didnt quit screen have high statu shoulder also carri slightest hint worri never know could happen father peopl she also bring lot emot weight come facial express she abl say much without speak from shock give short sweet smile make dramat beauti look film austin butler perform film quit suspens one not anoth new addit alreadi larg list charact bring vibe like when first meet charact color grade chang vibrant bright black white scheme give sinist look charact mani other i previous mention facial express florenc pugh excel job yet austin butler howev take beyond everyon expect the way brought sinist express effect azog the hobbit trilog film especi fulli cg render charact i person think outperform dave bautista stellan skarsgard boat play anoth role member famili timothe chalamet perform film far step ahead origin first film truli show he capabl actor evid toward later act film chalamet bring lot charm role paul allow audienc connect tap leadership role audienc may abl relat leader live chalamet take emot statu paul first film whole new level second film have previous laid back focu charact even though he heart film push limit time break barrier becom leader meant at end day dune part two phenomen piec cinema dont get often to see film big screen even imax still beauti film look thank greig fraser cinematograph would i recommend film gener audienc no slow burner mainli focus heavi charact develop come pure film lover shouldnt overlook
"The movie is an absolute perfection.

The story is super interesting. Director did an amazing job with this movie. The CGI is as real as it can get. The sound and music production is top notch.

The cast did amazing job with the acting. The way the protagonist changes his approach and attitude just gave me goosebumps. The CGI was top notch. Saw it in IMAX and it was totally worth it.

There is only some places where I felt that the story telling was a bit missed. How the protagonist raised to power and everyone's involvement in it was a little bit hazy. It felt like it all happened very fast and chances are you wont even notice it.

The Characters, the story, the soundtrack and even the peace felt so well done that is hard to believe that this movie is almost 3 hours long.

The wait for this sequel was totally worth it, Villanueve knows the exact way to take audience's breath and capture their attention, he's aware of the ""peace problem"" from the last part, that now has perfectioned something that it was already perfect, making the film felt more exciting and compelling.

"Cinematography is next level. The desert, the colors in every scene capture the mood so well. World building is good and we are introduced with new concepts bit by bit. Especially liked the intensity by Rutha.

The action scenes are well scripted. The protagonist looks vulnerable and is not like a usual action hero/savior of the world. CHemistry is great between female and male lead. Some funny moments as well, Javier bardem looks great in appearance and acting.

Even though the movie is long, one is looking forward to whats about to happen next. In the same league as part 1.

"I really don't get the hype.

Dune world in the books and even the 2000 miniseries is a world full of politics, subplots, many characters. DV part 2 was only about Paul. Every other character in the movie becomes one-dimensional. Lady Jessica a complete villain, the Emperor a weak character, Cheni a constantly annoyed girlfriend, Stilgar from leader to a ""blind"" follower, Irulan boring, Rabban a loser. Spacing Guild is completely missing and there is not even a mention why spice is SO important. A complex,immersive world was turned only to a personal story of Paul becoming the Messiah. 2000 miniseries did it better with 1% of the budget. Battle feels rushed, significant changes to the book have been changed, and key people are missing.

Obviously there is huge production value but plot being so watered-down made it a miss for me.

If you can get pass the low budget, just watch the 2000 miniseries.",i realli dont get hype dune world book even miniseri world full polit subplot mani charact dv part paul everi charact movi becom onedimension ladi jessica complet villain emperor weak charact cheni constantli annoy girlfriend stilgar leader blind follow irulan bore rabban loser space guild complet miss even mention spice so import a compleximmers world turn person stori paul becom messiah miniseri better budget battl feel rush signific chang book chang key peopl miss obvious huge product valu plot watereddown made miss if get pas low budget watch miniseri

Austin Butler was FASCINATING to watch, his voice, his expressions, his cruelty in this movie is mind-boggling.

"This movie has restored my faith in the cinema! Admittedly, I am a huge fan of the books and so I was already sold on this, but so often these days we see many franchises being brought to the big screen and totally disregarding the fan base to try and appeal to non-existent alternative audience. I am so pleased that the source material is respected and no character is compromised by any lazy script writing or misunderstanding of character arcs.

The cinematography is incredible with a real feel of a large scale desert planet and the battle scenes that feel like they have been pulled directly from Frank Herbert's mind with an emphasis on close combat sword fights in a sci-fi setting.

The acting from Timmy, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler is fantastic and should be recognised has top-class. In fact, I do not think you could find anyone better than Timothee to play Paul Atreides - the role was made for him!

Ultimately i felt a quite dissapoontes with the movies finale, feeling rushed and superficial. It happened in the dirst movie, as well as in the second.

All in all. It feel this movie could have been a lot better then it actually was if the final half focussed less on Zendaya and Chalamet and more on the actual story/pay-off.

Unfortunately the character of Chani was changed to much from the original. Omissions and changes for flow make sense, but this was purposeful and intended to change an important character. Maybe the director will go paint in a cell phone on the Mona Lisa to modernize it next. I am afraid that I am now out on his vision and will pay no attention to any future movies from him.

"I thought Dune (2021) was a masterpiece of film making so no surprise that Director D. V. wasn't even nominated for an Oscar or that Dune lost the Best Picture nod to an extremely minor film. Oscar irrelevancy aside, I was looking forward to Dune 2.

Unfortunately, the film was a resounding bore.

I even saw the movie twice wondering if I was missing something given the many positive reviews. However, the same failings I saw on my first viewing were equally evident on second viewing.

Here they are: the look and colours of the film are off, either too dark, or else blinding. It looked washed out and gloomy, a monochromatic wash. The acting is good but many of the lines are whispered so it's hard to hear or understand. Scene after scene of extreme closeups and dialogue ad nauseum. The film is a boring talkfest. Most egregious, the film plays out like a series of scenes strung together. There's little that drives this film, it is all one note.

He is a máster of visual time, due to the mature Of his visual skills a 3 hours movie feels fast, very easy to see, but even a child could wrote the dialogues of this movie, the story is full of blind spots...

Also I've missed some room for the supernatural and mystical essence that is present into the original book...rest value to the movie.

"I watched all 2 hours and 46 minutes of this film in a state of rapture. Our theater was silent. No one moved, no one spoke. No one got up to use the restroom. It was as if we were all transported to Arrakis together, and we had no choice but to experience every moment of it.

And it was glorious. To say this film is magnificent is an understatement. To say it's phenomenal does not fully explain its effect.

Every shot is tuned precisely to what we need to see. Every sound and musical cue is perfectly matched with its visual component. The acting is flawless across the board. The cinematography is absolutely brilliant.

Almost three hours of movie, and I wanted more. We all wanted more.

In my opinion, there are only three genre-defining fantasy stories: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Dune. After seeing Dune: Part One and this magnificent sequel, if I had to pick just one universe, I would choose the universe of Arrakis, of Caladan, of Paul and Chani, of Feyd and Baron, of Princess Irulan, every time.

"Dune: Part Two is a thrilling film that offers sensory and imaginative immersion. It features a lone figure atop a worm, a man trapped by a psychic seduction, and gladiatorial combat on an inhospitable planet. The film is a testament to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 gamble in adapting half of Frank Herbert's foundational sci-fi novel, with no guarantee of a sequel. The film's audacious moments and inhospitable environment make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. In the book ""Dune Messiah,"" the idea of heroic destiny is exposed as a lie created by others for colonization and control. Paul Atreides, a Fremen warrior, arrives on the desert planet of Arrakis, only to discover he is the product of generations of genetic manipulation by his mother, Lady Jessica, and her Bene Gesserit clan. Their work spreads whispers of a prophet, the Lisan al-Gaib, leading the indigenous Fremen people towards freedom. The House of Atreides falls, and Paul and Lady Jessica seek sanctuary and acceptance with a Fremen tribe. Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor, worries about her father's inaction. Herbert wrote the sequel, Dune Messiah, partly in response to those who believed they had failed to grasp the sinister implications of Paul's ascendancy. Villeneuve has expressed his ambition to turn Messiah into a third film, but it is no guarantee. The final third of Part Two emanates pure menace, unlike any other blockbuster in existence. Chalamet and Ferguson's performances in the film are criticized for being overly regal and dignified. Chani plays a crucial role as the moral center, Zendaya, with clarity and resolution. Stellan Skarsgård's Baron Harkonnen returns, and his nephew and heir, Feyd-Rautha, is introduced by Austin Butler. Butler's uncanny Skarsgård impersonation makes the audience question whether his sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are about to be replaced. Butler's portrayal of Sting in metal underpants and his entire body is a testament to his talent and dedication. Villeneuve's film, Part Two, honors the book's Middle Eastern and North African influences by incorporating Josh Brolin's performance as Paul's mentor, Gurney Halleck, and the use of HR Giger-inspired machines. The film is both grand and intimate, with Hans Zimmer's score and theatre seats rumbling with every cresting sand worm. However, it's crucial not to treat Dune's creative triumphs as a blanket absolution. The Arabic-inspired language of the book is now foregrounded, and onscreen representation is slightly improved, with Tunisian actor Souheila Yacoub playing Shishakli, Chani's closest ally.",dune part two thrill film offer sensori imagin immers it featur lone figur atop worm man trap psychic seduct gladiatori combat inhospit planet the film testament deni villeneuv gambl adapt half frank herbert foundat scifi novel guarante sequel the film audaci moment inhospit environ make mustwatch fan genr in book dune messiah idea heroic destini expo lie creat other colon control paul atreid fremen warrior arriv desert planet arraki discov product gener genet manipul mother ladi jessica bene gesserit clan their work spread whisper prophet lisan algaib lead indigen fremen peopl toward freedom the hous atreid fall paul ladi jessica seek sanctuari accept fremen tribe princess irulan daughter padishah emperor worri father inact herbert wrote sequel dune messiah partli respons believ fail grasp sinist implic paul ascend villeneuv express ambit turn messiah third film guarante the final third part two eman pure menac unlik blockbust exist chalamet ferguson perform film critic overli regal dignifi chani play crucial role moral center zendaya clariti resolut stellan skarsgrd baron harkonnen return nephew heir feydrautha introduc austin butler butler uncanni skarsgrd imperson make audienc question whether son alexand gustaf bill valter replac butler portray sting metal underp entir bodi testament talent dedic villeneuv film part two honor book middl eastern north african influenc incorpor josh brolin perform paul mentor gurney halleck use hr gigerinspir machin the film grand intim han zimmer score theatr seat rumbl everi crest sand worm howev crucial treat dune creativ triumph blanket absolut the arabicinspir languag book foreground onscreen represent slightli improv tunisian actor souheila yacoub play shishakli chani closest alli
"Saw this at the iMax 4 hours ago. Part 1 was on first, 30 min break and then Part 2 shown at 12:01 on release day.

Just absolutely stunning. The cast is spot on, the cinematography is spot on and the soundtrack is also spot on. Villeneuve has brought my 2 favourite films right bang up to date. I'm too tired to write any more at this point except to say that if you haven't done Bladerunner 2049 and Dune Parts 1 &2 yet then what are you doing. Treat yourself.

Dune is such an enthralling story, in it's own right, it deserves to be transferred into the two films that it now occupies. Jodorosky had his go, Lynch had his go and now Villeneuve has produced these 2 gems. I hope other film makers are paying attention. There's so much tosh being produced at the moment but Dune has re-kindled my belief that there are still great moments to be had in film making.

"Dune Part 2 is an exceptional film that delivers on all fronts. With stunning performances, adrenaline-pumping action sequences, and immersive world-building, it captivates audiences from start to finish. The cast's chemistry and talent shine through, elevating the storytelling to new heights. Denis Villeneuve masterfully crafts a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impact. Whether you're a fan of the books or not, Dune Part 2 is a must-watch that will leave you wanting more.

The cinematography in Dune Part 2 is truly mind-blowing, enhancing the film's visual appeal and immersive experience. While the movie deviates significantly from the second part of the book, it does so for the better. Adapting a challenging book is no easy feat, yet the film succeeds in making it accessible to a wider audience by infusing it with more action. This departure from the source material does not negatively affect the film, but the more action-packed ending ultimately enriches the viewing experience, making it a thrilling ride for both fans of the book and newcomers alike.",dune part except film deliv front with stun perform adrenalinepump action sequenc immers worldbuild captiv audienc start finish the cast chemistri talent shine elev storytel new height deni villeneuv master craft thrill cinemat experi leav last impact whether your fan book dune part mustwatch leav want the cinematographi dune part truli mindblow enhanc film visual appeal immers experi while movi deviat significantli second part book better adapt challeng book easi feat yet film succe make access wider audienc infus action thi departur sourc materi neg affect film actionpack end ultim enrich view experi make thrill ride fan book newcom alik
"Too easy to define it as impressive. For SFX, for acting, for fair and huge effort to adaptate a masterpiece.

"Visually stuning, a true masterpiece.

Anyone rating this movie anything under 10 needs to be admitted.

The movie was almost 3 hours long but I didn't want it to end. Absolutly brillant. The acting the storyline.

I remember Dune 1984 being one of my favorite movie as a kid and then discovering the books after and then the video games. This movie honors them all and it's so rare for a movie to honor the books it was based of.

The soundtrack, like the part 1, is a masterpiece.

I never wrote a review on here before, but my goodness I left the theater feeling like my life was empty now. I need to see it again.

I sure hope they will release an extended cut.",visual stune true masterpiec anyon rate movi anyth need admit the movi almost hour long i didnt want end absolutli brillant the act storylin i rememb dune one favorit movi kid discov book video game thi movi honor rare movi honor book base the soundtrack like part masterpiec i never wrote review good i left theater feel like life empti i need see i sure hope releas extend cut
"Part one... killer. No filler.

Part two... what the? Too many big departures from the book.

Part two felt like it needed to be wrapped up by the end... and that the studio don't wanna bank on Part three. Also, the script, in parts, was woeful. Teenage stuff. I also think it could have been trimmed a little in the editing department. It felt flabby to me.

That all said, there were some great elements. The costumes are next level good. Zimmer's score is incredible. The cinematography is grand....

Please let there be a director's cut for this. I'd love to see Villeneuve's unencumbered cut.

"Three hours of boredom, yes, that's right-three hours of clock-watching boredom, wondering if you need to take a whizz.

""Dune: Part Two"" is essentially driven by hype and Denis Villeneuve fans who truly haven't grasped that his work, though spectacular on the cinematography front, is limited in terms of dialogue and character building, shielded by an aesthetic that gives the impression that such projects are impressive.

""Dune: Part Two"" is laden with lazy CGI, wooden acting, and poor casting choices that drive this movie further into the ground. The screenplay and pacing are banal, and certain scenes are poorly planned.

There is little to be excited by, and you don't need to have read the book to have a take on this, given that is the point of adaptations.",three hour boredom ye that rightthre hour clockwatch boredom wonder need take whizz dune part two essenti driven hype deni villeneuv fan truli havent grasp work though spectacular cinematographi front limit term dialogu charact build shield aesthet give impress project impress dune part two laden lazi cgi wooden act poor cast choic drive movi ground the screenplay pace banal certain scene poorli plan there littl excit dont need read book take given point adapt
"I do not want to 'overhype' the movie. I loved part one so much. However, I think that part two is even better than part one. The cinematography is obviously as incredible or better than part one, but somehow even the character development, the plot, and the action are all incredible too. This movie is more intense and the stakes feel much higher.

The soundtrack perfectly complements the visuals, leaving you entranced and in awe throughout the movie. The incredible imagery shines through. The rise to power throughout the movie gives off a sense of power and an exuberant sense of overwhelming strength.

Overall, I suggest watching this movie.

"This... is cinema at its finest.

Just watched Dune Part Two in an IMAX theater, and it was inarguably the best cinematic, spiritual experience I've ever had. As a fan of the novels, I am in awe of how the characters from the second half of Dune (1965) comes to life with the stellar cast.

Denis's storytelling was on point - the religious aspect and the Fremen culture in particular resonated with me the most since Part One. From the incredible sound design, Zimmer's score, ancient-futuristic production design, Fraser's cinematography and his clever use of B&W imagery to the entertaining screenplay, flawless editing, and the stunning visual effects, this motion picture might just be the culmination of Villeneuve's career. He has leveled up his game with Dune Part Two. Working on this scale requires mastery in filmmaking, which he has achieved flawlessly. Enjoyed every single frame of this movie. Cleverly embraced the looser adaptations of the book and aligned it to the plot.

Dune Part Two is constantly challenged by conflicting political decisions, sociology, cultural influences, and religion. Yet the heart of it is a love story that carries the flow and weight of all.

I stood up from my seat awe-struck, overwhelmed after the immersive consumption of a classic, top-tier space opera masterpiece, and got the chills down my spine during the ending credits.

I'm thrilled to see how this trilogy ends when Dune: Messiah makes a comeback. Most recommended to watch it in the biggest screen you can get- preferably IMAX. For now, I'll have to rewatch and be anticipating for its Oscar sweep next year.",thi cinema finest just watch dune part two imax theater inargu best cinemat spiritu experi ive ever a fan novel i awe charact second half dune come life stellar cast deniss storytel point religi aspect fremen cultur particular reson sinc part one from incred sound design zimmer score ancientfuturist product design fraser cinematographi clever use bw imageri entertain screenplay flawless edit stun visual effect motion pictur might culmin villeneuv career he level game dune part two work scale requir masteri filmmak achiev flawlessli enjoy everi singl frame movi cleverli embrac looser adapt book align plot dune part two constantli challeng conflict polit decis sociolog cultur influenc religion yet heart love stori carri flow weight i stood seat awestruck overwhelm immers consumpt classic toptier space opera masterpiec got chill spine end credit im thrill see trilog end dune messiah make comeback most recommend watch biggest screen get prefer imax for ill rewatch anticip oscar sweep next year
"Describing a movie as flawless might seem foolish, yet for ""Dune: Part Two,"" such a claim is apt. Simply put, this film embodies flawlessness.

Dune embodies the essence of every sci-fi epic, and beyond. It sets the standard every movie should aspire to reach, for I, in awe, endured 166 minutes, as did the entire theater, captivated by its sheer brilliance.

Denis Villeneuve is truly passionate about his work, and it shines through on screen. He ensures that every detail, from cinematography to choreography, is crafted with an extraordinary level of care and attention.

Throughout its riveting 166-minute runtime, I was never once distracted. It only grew more captivating with each passing moment, and oh, that second half - it was, quite simply, the most astonishing thing I've witnessed in years.

Every member of the cast delivered stellar performance's, contributing to the film's excellence. Special commendation goes to Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem for their outstanding contributions, which, in my view, elevated the movie to new heights of cinematic achievement.

""Dune"" boasts awe-inspiring makeup, costumes, art direction, and performances that dare to redefine cinematic excellence. As we eagerly anticipate ""Dune: Part Two,"" it's clear this saga will boldly etch its legacy as a fearless masterpiece, thanks in no small part to the daring vision of Greig Fraser.

While it's still in theaters, catch it on IMAX. Trust me, it's an experience you won't soon forget - the cinematic event of the decade.

"I LOVED this movie. I only recently watched Dune part 1 a few months ago and was so taken away by it, (and so regretful for not watching it in theatres to get the full experience) I had high expectations and it exceeded. The pacing in the 2nd half did feel a little rushed compared to the first half but this was such a beautiful movie all around. This has been the ONLY movie that I am (and will) pay a full price ticket for to watch again and again in theatres. Down to the acting, visuals, writing, score, special effects, sound effects, etc.

It hits all the marks for me.

Special shout out to Javier Bardem for making me crack up with his character!! (LISAN AL GAIB!!) All of the cast was phenomenal!

I am sure this movie will win TONS of well deserved awards.

"Co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve, the story takes place right after the end of part one in which Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

It's kinda sad to remember that I am among those people who missed the opportunity to witness Dune: Part One in the theatres. However, I just watched it out of curiosity because it looked promising and I didn't have the slightest clue what it was all about. But what excites me about this kind of movie is that it'll always get better every time you watch it again. Things become much clearer and that's when I hop on the Dune bandwagon, the sequel is just two times better in terms of, well basically everything. It's kinda a privilege as a movie fan to get to experience a movie as immersive as this and Oppenheimer two years in a row. I guess this is what it feels like to live in the '90s, '80s, or even '70s when genre-defining movies are born, such as Star Wars (because it's the same genre).

So basically Part One is just an introduction to all the characters, motives, the center of the story, etc. Though I'd say it is a fair introduction rather than perfect because as I said before, it's definitely not an easy watch for everyone especially those who never read the book. As for the sequel, it really is a perfect continuation that takes us right back into the story and explores more about why it all happened in the first place. Both Paul's and Jessica's development are written perfectly without overlapping and leaving the other one weak as a result. The performances of the actors and actresses were just perfect, they played their parts perfectly. Though his screen time is short, Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is definitely the one for me, he gave it all out and was completely unrecognizable.

You know what, I'm out of words to describe just how good-looking this movie is from the technical standpoint.

"That was fantastic! Hans Zimmer's score was incredible, and each scene took me on a journey through different parts of my brain. It sparked so many memories! Thanks for this amazing cinematic experience.

I also loved the movie's exploration of undiscovered potential within the human mind. It seems like they were hinting at that throughout the film. I'm even more intrigued to see where the story leads.

Visually beautiful but unhappy with the changes from the source material. The performances were great especially Chalamet as Paul and Zendaya as Chani. Butler was also stunning as Feyd and one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a while. One major character completely left out with some very random mentions. A few other key characters left out are a bit more understandable with the time restraints. Not as much world building on the Fremen as I would've liked. Some characters felt completely different than the novel. The third act was rushed. You spend less time with Irulan and the Emperor in the books but somehow their presence felt skippable in the film. He was so close.,visual beauti unhappi chang sourc materi the perform great especi chalamet paul zendaya chani butler also stun feyd one best fight scene ive seen one major charact complet left random mention a key charact left bit understand time restraint not much world build fremen i wouldv like some charact felt complet differ novel the third act rush you spend less time irulan emperor book somehow presenc felt skippabl film he close

"Watched the movie on TV via Amazon with great expectation and though the CGI was exceptional (aren't they all?) I was left with feeling less than completely satisfied. When will filmmakers understand that the lower-quality TV transmissions of movies fail to show any detail in night-time scenes? All characters spoke American with the exception of a Zorba-type who was, somehow, Greek. There were occasional efforts to acknowledge the original book though such was evidently not the in director's remit, but for the most part the plot was incomprehensible. Unlike the 1987 version which is much superior in most respects. As might have been expected, the unsatisfactory ending (I was left with a feeling of being left, not so much in mid-air as low orbit) closed with the opportunity of a further sequel but as with most sequels they are but pale shadows of earlier versions. In this case, the 1987 movie. Or best of all, read the book.

"What do I not understand about this movie?

Now that I have seen it, and see both user shares here (mostly with Masterpiece as the title) and in various professional reviews praising and praising this film. I count on many ""not useful"" after publishing what I now have in mind, but stand well in it; I don't think this movie is particularly good.

Dune part 1 was, for me, a promising start (although I prefer movies to have an ending). Rarely have I been more disappointed than when I finally got to see Dune Part 2. I'll explain:

The 1 was the prelude, I thought. Unlike David Lynch's 1984 Dune, director Denis Villeneuve used Part 2 to establish the story, the characters. I could then forgive that, in that film too, I thought the whole thing was slow, and partly boring. (although the Dune part 1 film was also beautifully shot). I thought that Part 2 would offer more action-oriented, exciting action than it largely does.

Part 2 continues in the same vein as the first film; endless dialogues, a slow love story that never quite convinces, endless scenes (beautiful yes) of sand/desert scenery. A long period where endless time and scenes are spent on the main character's ""inner struggle"" about what he should become and do.

When the film finally has some punch, the showdown between Paul Atreides and House Harkonnen and the Emperor remains incredibly tame and unexciting. One fight scene, and then it's all over.

Timothée Chalamet is a shooting star and a skilled actor. But he doesn't convince me in this movie. I don't think he's suited to be a tough leader in a grand sci fi adventure like this is supposed to be. For me in this role. I actually don't think he fits this role. So this was jarring for me as well.

A bunch of the best actors we have today are on the cast list. Of little help to me. The scenes with the worms are only marginally better made than in the 1984 version. Is it not possible to achieve something better with today's technology?

I read that the third Dune movie is in the works. I'm not going to spend money on watching it. Maybe when it comes on a streaming service I have.

"Wow! Dune: Part Two blew us away! It's easily one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. Everything about it was amazing!

The story flowed seamlessly from Part One, and even though it's nearly three hours long, it didn't feel like it. The pacing was perfect, and we were hooked from start to finish.

The special effects were incredibly realistic, and the actors portrayed their characters brilliantly. The chemistry between them felt genuine, and nothing seemed fake or forced.

Director Denis Villeneuve did an outstanding job, and the action scenes were mind-blowing. The sound in IMAX was incredible, making the experience even more immersive.

Hans Zimmer's score was masterful, and it added so much to the film. Overall, Dune: Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise it's getting.

"Just when I thought that Denis could not out-do his Bladerunner. Don't get me wrong, first part of Dune was beautifully executed, however Part 2 shines like a beacon of hope for the Art of Cinema. Editting is superb to the tee, visually the film is to be studied for many ears ahead. But! In order to keep it up to the 3 hour mark there wer cut-offs from script and time-line. I would have easily accepted this divided in two parts, just so the gaps of inbetween (especially for those who have read the books) were spared. Nevertheless, the job was masterfully done.

"Finally a modern day epic that lives up to its lore!

Denis Villeneuve, achieved several notable accomplishments. Firstly, it successfully adapted Frank Herbert's complex and beloved novel into a visually stunning and immersive cinematic experience.

Stunning visuals, intricate world-building, and faithful interpretation of the source material. Additionally, Villeneuve's direction skillfully balanced action, politics, and philosophy, creating a rich narrative that appealed to both fans of the book and newcomers to the Dune universe. Moreover, the film's cast, including Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, delivered compelling performances that brought the characters to life. Overall, Villeneuve's ""Dune"" Must be hailed a masterpiece.

This film delivers on every aspect of an epic. The acting, the cinematography, the story. All fantastic. I struggle to find the superlatives to properly describe this movie.

"Dennis did his job well. Cinematographer Greig Fraser went next level. The second part is much more better than the part I. And yeah, the music is so sensational and chilling. The main theme brings goosebumps. Hans Zimmer the legend. This movie is meant to be seen in cinema houses. IMAX would be much more interesting. The first half of the movie is slow paced, not slow-slow but political, and then after the intermission is where it gets bombed. Paul aka Timothee really played his character well.

"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune 2"" is an ambitious continuation of the epic saga, delivering stunning visuals and a gripping narrative that captivates audiences. While the film is undeniably a cinematic triumph, it's not without its shortcomings.

Notably, the adaptation overlooks critical aspects such as 'the weirding way' and 'prana-bindu'-key elements of Herbert's universe that enrich the lore and depth of the story. Lynch's way maybe was a bad representation with the sounds guns and stuff (keep in mind the age and lack of tech like today).

Moreover, the marginalization of Alia Atreides' role diminishes the character's significance and her intricate relationship with the overarching plot. These omissions, while not detracting from the overall enjoyment of the movie, leave a palpable void for fans familiar with the source material.",deni villeneuv dune ambiti continu epic saga deliv stun visual grip narr captiv audienc while film undeni cinemat triumph without shortcom notabl adapt overlook critic aspect weird way pranabindukey element herbert univers enrich lore depth stori lynch way mayb bad represent sound gun stuff keep mind age lack tech like today moreov margin alia atreid role diminish charact signific intric relationship overarch plot these omiss detract overal enjoy movi leav palpabl void fan familiar sourc materi
"This is a terrible sequel to Part 1 - it is dreary, boring, slow, makes no sense, the actors seem asleep and the dialog often is confusing. The special effects and imagery are flat, with just one color ""sand"" and the sequences often make not sense wandering around, then fighting with seemingly few objectives to the point of the movie. I do like Denis Villeneuve especially Sicario the first one with such intensity though looking bad all his movies have far too many logic flaws and seems like no one was going to ask him where any of these movies are going though Sicario 1 does have a great ending.

"A cinematic masterpiece: Denis Villaneuve's vision is a masterful and beautiful adaptation of this great story. Top tier on all levels, this film had me hooked from beginning to end, I loved every minute of it. This was cinema and sci-fi at its best. The scope was epic, the shots were beautiful, the characters are iconic, and the music is captivating.

The world of dune has never felt more real and lived in, the set design is beautiful and filled with details. The characters are endearing and interesting.

Hans has done it again with an amazing score that gave me chills and immersed me into the story from beginning to the end.

"Part one of Villeneuve's dune was following the book quite closely. Small changes that it made were probably for the best, no one is going to miss lasguns. Liet was gender swapped for some reason, that was the biggest unnecessary change that I can think of. So, it would make perfect sense that since first movie followed the book closely, the second is going to do so, too?

Part two is light years away from the book. A bunch of characters have been changed completely. Aliya is not even born. Stilgar is nothing like Stilgar from the books. Chani, a side character from the books, is now a central character in the plot. In fact, on most of the posters for the movie, she is next to Paul, standing as high as him, she even occludes him. I guess every movie these days must have a girl boss. Zandaya is a bigger start that Chalmet, so studio was promoting her more.

Does that mean that Part Two is a bad movie? No, it's still well crafted and it actually manages to preserve the key ideas of the book. I do think that Part One was the better of the two, though.",part one villeneuv dune follow book quit close small chang made probabl best one go miss lasgun liet gender swap reason biggest unnecessari chang i think so would make perfect sen sinc first movi follow book close second go part two light year away book a bunch charact chang complet aliya even born stilgar noth like stilgar book chani side charact book central charact plot in fact poster movi next paul stand high even occlud i guess everi movi day must girl bos zandaya bigger start chalmet studio promot doe mean part two bad movi no still well craft actual manag preserv key idea book i think part one better two though
"This Movie is something really special. Of course it is a strange Journey on strange planets, but there is so much humanity and exestentialism involved, it becomes a very universal story.

This Story, the score and the cinemateography is pure poetry from beginning to end. Denis Villeneuve stepped up his craft in a major way, exceeding already enormous expextations and creating Images no one has ever seen. It is a landmark in movie making that has to be experienced in a cinema.

The cast gives amazing performances, but Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya and Austin Butler are the stand outs of the movie.

"Dune,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, stands as a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, epitomizing the perfect fusion of visionary storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and captivating performances. As the second installment in Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga, ""Dune 2"" surpasses its predecessor in every aspect, solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating.

One of the most striking elements of ""Dune 2"" is its visual prowess. From the barren landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe. Cinematographer Greig Fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet, using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe. The visual effects, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhance the film's otherworldly atmosphere, transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangible.

However, ""Dune 2"" is not merely a feast for the eyes; it is also a triumph of storytelling. Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of Herbert's novel, distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience. The film's pacing is expertly calibrated, allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension. Each scene is imbued with meaning, contributing to the overarching themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.

Central to the film's success are the performances of its ensemble cast. Timothée Chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as Paul Atreides, the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy. Chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role, embodying Paul's internal struggle with grace and nuance. Opposite him, Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother torn between duty and love. Ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity, elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fiction.

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Oscar Isaac commands the screen as Duke Leto Atreides, projecting authority and compassion in equal measure. Zendaya captivates as Chani, the mysterious Fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict. Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem round out the ensemble, delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the film's ensemble.

Beyond its technical and narrative achievements, ""Dune 2"" is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry. At its core, the film grapples with timeless questions about power, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through Paul's journey, we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership. Villeneuve deftly explores these themes, challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and values.

In addition to its thematic richness, ""Dune 2"" is a masterclass in world-building. Villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought Herbert's universe to life, from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions. Every detail, from the costumes to the set design, is thoughtfully crafted to immerse the audience in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants. The result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything they've ever seen before.

In conclusion, ""Dune 2"" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerhouse performances, it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic. Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve. ""Dune 2"" is not just a film; it's an experience-one that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come.",dune direct deni villeneuv stand monument achiev modern filmmak epitom perfect fusion visionari storytel breathtak visual captiv perform a second instal villeneuv adapt frank herbert epic scienc fiction saga dune surpass predecessor everi aspect solidifi statu cinemat masterpiec deserv perfect rate one strike element dune visual prowess from barren landscap arraki intric design technolog futurist univers everi frame meticul craft immers audienc rich tapestri herbert univers cinematograph greig fraser master captur grandeur desert planet use sweep shot dynam camera movement evok sen scale awe the visual effect seamlessli integr narr enhanc film otherworldli atmospher transport viewer univers imposs becom tangibl howev dune mere feast eye also triumph storytel villeneuv screenwrit jon spaiht skill navig complex narr herbert novel distil intric plot multifacet charact coher engross cinemat experi the film pace expertli calibr allow stori unfold organ maintain sen urgenc tension each scene imbu mean contribut overarch theme power destini human condit central film success perform ensembl cast timoth chalamet deliv tour de forc perform paul atreid reluct hero burden weight propheci chalamet bring depth vulner role embodi paul intern struggl grace nuanc opposit rebecca ferguson shine ladi jessica paul mother torn duti love ferguson infus charact strength complex elev beyond typic femal archetyp often found scienc fiction the support cast equal impress actor bring agam tabl oscar isaac command screen duke leto atreid project author compass equal measur zendaya captiv chani mysteri fremen warrior caught midst brew conflict josh brolin javier bardem round ensembl deliv memor perform add depth dimens film ensembl beyond technic narr achiev dune triumph themat depth philosoph inquiri at core film grappl timeless question power ident natur human through paul journey forc confront consequ action moral complex leadership villeneuv deftli explor theme challeng audienc reflect belief valu in addit themat rich dune masterclass worldbuild villeneuv creativ team painstakingli brought herbert univers life intricaci polit landscap nuanc cultur tradit everi detail costum set design thought craft immers audienc world arraki inhabit the result fulli realiz immers cinemat experi transport viewer distant futur unlik anyth theyv ever seen in conclus dune noth short cinemat triumph with breathtak visual compel storytel powerhous perform surpass predecessor cement modern classic deni villeneuv creat masterpiec honor frank herbert semin work also push boundari scienc fiction cinema achiev dune film experienceon deserv celebr rememb year come
"Visually stunning, yes. But tbh as someone who both loved the books as well as the 1984 version by David Lynch. I felt this movie lacked in character depth.

Compare the characters of

Baron Vladimir Harkonnen by B Kenneth McMillan (Dune 1984) to Stellan Skarsgård.

One is crazy, scary and just plain Harkonnen whereas Stellan (and I do love him in some movies, just not this one) is just quiet, undaunting and almost boring in comparison.

Then you have Chani.. which left me speechless and almost ruined the whole experience. Her character was so far out of context for the Dune universe that it made me cringe multiple times and wish for another actor/character.

Dune kills off it's best actor far too quickly (You know who) Jason Momoa is typical Jason Momoa zero depth. Zendaya is of course the typical Zendaya.. angry face, angry character. Mary Jane, can do everything.

I truly despise this day and age of film making, where movie's are lauded more for the CGI than anything else. Character depth and acting should still be at the forefront before anything else.

Dune part 2 is no different to part 1 in my opinion. Both are solid, with top notch CGI & sound effects. But the characters fall flat for me all bar a couple and the ending with Charni and the changes that they made to her character left a sour taste in my mouth after the movie.

Masterpiece? In CGI and sound, yes. In every other department?

Absolutely not.

Still very solid but very overrated. BUT considering the garbage most people are fed these days I guess I can see why some people think it's a masterpiece.",visual stun ye but tbh someon love book well version david lynch i felt movi lack charact depth compar charact baron vladimir harkonnen b kenneth mcmillan dune stellan skarsgrd one crazi scari plain harkonnen wherea stellan i love movi one quiet undaunt almost bore comparison then chani left speechless almost ruin whole experi her charact far context dune univers made cring multipl time wish anoth actorcharact dune kill best actor far quickli you know jason momoa typic jason momoa zero depth zendaya cours typic zendaya angri face angri charact mari jane everyth i truli despis day age film make movi laud cgi anyth el charact depth act still forefront anyth el dune part differ part opinion both solid top notch cgi sound effect but charact fall flat bar coupl end charni chang made charact left sour tast mouth movi masterpiec in cgi sound ye in everi depart absolut still solid overr but consid garbag peopl fed day i guess i see peopl think masterpiec
"This is the kind of film, no, experience that comes along once in awhile.

Villeneuve and co bring every incredible aspect of filmmaking to bear in this heart-pounding, gasp for breath, sensory assault that truly takes the viewer out of their seat and immerses them in the story.

It felt as if one we're witnessing not just a story unfolding on screen, with masterful sound ( and perhaps infrasound) epic cinematography, sublime sequences, superlative production, fastidious costume design, terrific acting from the entire cast - this viewer felt as if I were witnessing something real, such was the intensity of the roller coaster type experience.

I was initially concerned at the run time, but 3 hours was enough for Viileneuve to translate one of the most difficult novels to screen.

Additionally, and as a keen historian, philosophy and mythology enthusiast I recognised many motifs drawn from the oldest myths - themes that could easily have felt tired, trite, and banal, were displayed refreshingly and with an authenticity that made me smile with satisfaction-such subtle nods and references to old themes so well done it was a celebration of thousands of years of storytelling, allegory, metaphor, and myth.

This, unlike so many tainted films and series of our time avoided tokenism, political messaging, virtue signaling and all the other shallow cultural cliches which was refreshing in and of itself.

The masterful displays by the matriarchal priestesses lead by the inimitable Charlotte Rampling pays homage to the Ancient pre Abrahamic, pre Egyptian cultures of the late Bronze Age where priestesses were matriarchs and exercised great power and influence.

The references to the 'Djinn' was also one that delighted this viewer.

In fact, this story is closer to our own history and mythology with a few exceptions, blurring the line between sci fi and history.

Finally all I can say is that this piece must be experienced on the big screen with dynamic sound to be fully appreciated.

It certainly deserves all the accolades and praise as it is truly an instant classic, and I'm sure will become a cult classic whose influence will persevere for some time to come.",thi kind film experi come along awhil villeneuv co bring everi incred aspect filmmak bear heartpound gasp breath sensori assault truli take viewer seat immers stori it felt one wit stori unfold screen master sound perhap infrasound epic cinematographi sublim sequenc superl product fastidi costum design terrif act entir cast viewer felt i wit someth real intens roller coaster type experi i initi concern run time hour enough viileneuv translat one difficult novel screen addit keen historian philosophi mytholog enthusiast i recognis mani motif drawn oldest myth theme could easili felt tire trite banal display refreshingli authent made smile satisfactionsuch subtl nod refer old theme well done celebr thousand year storytel allegori metaphor myth thi unlik mani taint film seri time avoid token polit messag virtu signal shallow cultur clich refresh the master display matriarch priestess lead inimit charlott rampl pay homag ancient pre abraham pre egyptian cultur late bronz age priestess matriarch exercis great power influenc the refer djinn also one delight viewer in fact stori closer histori mytholog except blur line sci fi histori final i say piec must experienc big screen dynam sound fulli appreci it certainli deserv accolad prais truli instant classic im sure becom cult classic whose influenc persever time come
"Mr. Villeneuve must have scored a big payday on this one, but there are clear indications that he relinquished creative control to do so, or to put it in old-fashioned terms, sold his soul. His work, when unhindered, is much more mature, and I can only imagine what he would have served us given free rein.

His hand is still detected in the visuals - cinematography, set and costume design. That's what those two stars have purchased. Maybe there should be another half a star for Rebecca Ferguson, the only actor who earned their salary in the film. The remainder of the cast can be summed up as two entitled, spoiled young people acting like entitled, spoiled young people, surrounded by slightly more mature adults who try half heartedly to take it all seriously. You can see, on occasion, a glint in the eye of Josh Brolin or Javier Braden, trying to stifle giggles when Timothy or that funny Z girl scream in rage or brood, but maybe the thought of all the dollars pouring into their bank account helped restrain the mirth.

It's easy to get carried away by the splendid graphics, but at heart a good film is characterized by brilliance in acting and storytelling, and this film has neither.

Perverting the source material in favour of modern narratives is likewise a major flaw, I wonder how much longer we will have such crimes inflicted upon us. Classics are classics for a reason. It's not a complex reason. It's really simple: a great many people have enjoyed and been inspired by them, so they endure. When you change the source material, it becomes weak or anemic, and dies pretty soon after. By dies, I mean people lose interest in it quickly.

Whatever popularity the two part Dune remake is enjoying is due to being the least bad thing out there on the silver screen.

"I am floored with the production value of the whole film. Every shot looks amazing, the sound design and score are flawless, the script is a masterclass in writing (there is SO much exposition that needs to happen that doesn't feel like exposition at all). Performances, effects, sets, costuming, everything is immaculate. I was seriously worried I would set my expectations too high seeing early reviews and I'd be let down but NO.

Even the major changes it makes in adapting the source material only serve to keep the focus of the movie tighter and keeps the pacing of the movie where it needs to be. Every decision feels thought out and very deliberate.

Managing character development in a film with a large ensemble cast can be a daunting task, but here it was executed flawlessly. Each main and supporting character brought something unique to the table, enriching the narrative and adding depth to the story.

From the seamless editing to the captivating score, the stunning cinematography to the exceptional acting, every aspect of this film was executed to perfection. Watching it in IMAX only heightened the experience, elevating it to a whole new level of cinematic brilliance.

As Paul prepares to lead a revolution on the desert planet of Arrakis, he grapples with his burgeoning powers, the weight of prophecy, and the complex political landscape of the universe.

Visual and Technical Mastery: Denis Villeneuve's direction remains as visionary as ever, with Dune: Part Two further expanding on the breathtaking visuals that defined the first film. The grandiose landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with even greater detail, showcasing sweeping desert vistas, intricate sand dunes, and awe-inspiring action sequences.

"The movie we waited for and been hyped for did not disappoint when it comes to cinematography. Visually 10/10, it makes you live in the Dune universe. And then once you're in it, you wait for the plot to build up. Which they tried doing but never really even scratched the full potential of the characters or the abilities of this brilliant cast. The conversations were choppy, the emotions were shallow, the viewer couldn't really connect to any of the character's emotions or journey. Let alone those of Paul. Me as a viewer couldn't emotionally attach to Chani & Paul's love. It was only introduced briefly here and there while we are actually being focused on Paul's emotional growth/development journey. Also, with such a heavy press tour & the background that was given to the viewer that Zendaya & Timothy are best friend in real life, it was even harder to feel their on screen chemistry.",the movi wait hype disappoint come cinematographi visual make live dune univers and your wait plot build which tri never realli even scratch full potenti charact abil brilliant cast the convers choppi emot shallow viewer couldnt realli connect charact emot journey let alon paul me viewer couldnt emot attach chani paul love it introduc briefli actual focus paul emot growthdevelop journey also heavi press tour background given viewer zendaya timothi best friend real life even harder feel screen chemistri
"Dune 2, crafted by the visionary Denis Villeneuve, is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this epic sci-fi saga transports audiences to a breathtaking universe filled with rich lore, stunning visuals, and unforgettable performances.

"Star-studded, technically impecabble, cinematographically amazing and continuously bombastic.

Like it's predecessor, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a genuine cinematic experience, executed with a lot of palpable effort and technical greatness.

Villeneuve has achieved an epic blockbuster, entertaining and artistic as it can be.

Filled with a rich variety of characters, new and old, and with a multitude of storylinest the movie aims to translate the depth and wideness of Frank Herbert's novel. Altough I do not care about it, like some faithful followers of the literary work, one has to acknowledge that the film's translation could never have matched it. This is simply due to technical capabilities.

Nonetheless the movie is overall very impressive with a captivating party. It is not perfect, as shown in my point of view, with the pacing problems. In fact, while the last part is utterly epic, it's rapidity shows structural flaws in the narative level.

The film ends again with a teaser for the third film. The final installment of the Dune Trilogy announces itself as topping everything the two previous movies have achieved. It will be epic.",starstud technic impecabbl cinematograph amaz continu bombast like predecessor dune part two genuin cinemat experi execut lot palpabl effort technic great villeneuv achiev epic blockbust entertain artist fill rich varieti charact new old multitud storylinest movi aim translat depth wide frank herbert novel altough i care like faith follow literari work one acknowledg film translat could never match thi simpli due technic capabl nonetheless movi overal impress captiv parti it perfect shown point view pace problem in fact last part utterli epic rapid show structur flaw nar level the film end teaser third film the final instal dune trilog announc top everyth two previou movi achiev it epic
"Every scene is a clip of its own and there is nothing connecting them.

To break down the plot; fight scene, timothy and zendaya kiss scene, fighting some more, then some weird post apocaliptic bad guys rambling about spices, some more fight scene, another cgi scene, then repeat once more.

Honestly after every scene I counted the minutes they wasted of my life. It is probably the worst film I've seen.

I completely understand why it has such a high rating, you can have chalamet and zendaya in an instagram reel and make it to imdb top250 list apparently.

I might have liked it if I was a member of the Gen-Z. Unfortunately, I'm not and I'm dragged to see this garbage by my wife who is Gen-Z.

"There is not many near 3 hour films I could sit through and stay not only entertained but totally connected to the story. This film went beyond my expectations. It is hard sometimes making a sequel and living up to the first movie but it did just that. I totally agree with the Director that you could watch the second installment without watching the first but you would be missing out. Everything from the cinematography, sound, music to the story itself, I was awestruck by the finished product. Though the film does start out slow, it quickly picks up and runs with it. I very much look forward to part 3 as it leaves you with much more to the adventure still to be told. In my opinion, this is by far one of the greatest films I have seen in recent years.",there mani near hour film i could sit stay entertain total connect stori thi film went beyond expect it hard sometim make sequel live first movi i total agre director could watch second instal without watch first would miss everyth cinematographi sound music stori i awestruck finish product though film start slow quickli pick run i much look forward part leav much adventur still told in opinion far one greatest film i seen recent year
This is a great film in so many different ways. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a long time. I did not see Austin Butler...he was bought into his role as Feyd so well that I couldn't take my eyes off of him when he was on screen. Rebecca Ferguson's performance was so nuanced and subtle it gave me goosebumps at times. And the ending...powerful and heartbreaking all at once. Well done! This is a master class in epic filmmaking and hits all the right spots. One of the rare occasions when I've walked out of a theater and wanted to walk right back in and watch the film again. The only thing that would've made this better is if I could've watched part one as a double feature!,thi great film mani differ way the cinematographi best ive seen long time i see austin butlerh bought role feyd well i couldnt take eye screen rebecca ferguson perform nuanc subtl gave goosebump time and endingpow heartbreak well done thi master class epic filmmak hit right spot one rare occas ive walk theater want walk right back watch film the thing wouldv made better i couldv watch part one doubl featur
"Dune: Part 2 is the best sci-fi film of all time, and it's not even close! The music, the cinematography, the dialogue, the action... what could you possibly compare it to? Has to be up there with the best in terms of sequels as well, as it outmatches the Dune: Part One in every single way possible. I will be thinking about this film forever and I can't wait to see it again. I am usually let down when a movie has this much hype, but this one truly lives up to it and then some. I will say that Walken as the emperor could have been done better and perhaps played by someone else, but that does not take away from the brilliance of this film.

"Damn what a movie not gonna spoil or say to much about it. This is a movie you just have to whiteness it for yourself in a CINEMA preferably with Dolby Atmos. Because damn the sound and ofcourse the music by Hans Zimmer is so on point with the stuff you see on screen.

The openings scenes is one of the best I have seen in a movie in a while the cinematography used in that sequence was superb sucked you immediately in the movie great job by Denis Villeneuve.

Not sure if it is better then part 1 but definitely on the same level gave them both a 9. For the ones wondering it has more action then the first 1 gladly it wasn't over the top blockbuster action.

Few sequels are better than the first, this one is one of them.

This was shot wonderfully, you can tell they spent every dollar to make you feel like you were on another world. The action was great. My main critique with the first one was that it was a little slow, I didn't get that from this one. The battle within Paul's self really comes through on the screen. There wasn't one bad performance in this movie. This movie should be the new standard that all movies should try to reach.

"Yes, Dune: Part Two looks fantastic. Better than the first movie, I dare say. But it felt to me that I was watching a highly expurgated version of the film. Even at close to 3 hours, it seemed very much incomplete and condensed, to the detriment of the story.

Scenes (and thus, major parts of the plot) jumped around haphazardly. I don't mind not having every little thing spelled out for me in a movie, but there were nearly a dozen times where I thought, ""Wait, did I miss something? What happened between the previous scene and this one?""

I honestly have to wonder if the original was a far longer cut of the film, and the studio made the director cut it way down for distribution. Because it could easily use an additional hour, at minimum, to fill in gaps.

As a result, I didn't care about any of the characters at all, so nothing resonated with me emotionally. Oh, they tried their best, with plenty of bombastic music cues, and grandiose shots of troops and ships and worms -- but in the end, it all amounted to far less than the sum of its parts.

So, with all that said, you may think 5/10 is a generous rating for me to give, but I appreciate there was at least some effort given to this film -- art design, effects, cinematography, sound design, were all top-notch. Too bad the rest of it fell so short for me.",ye dune part two look fantast better first movi i dare say but felt i watch highli expurg version film even close hour seem much incomplet condens detriment stori scene thu major part plot jump around haphazardli i dont mind everi littl thing spell movi nearli dozen time i thought wait i miss someth what happen previou scene one i honestli wonder origin far longer cut film studio made director cut way distribut becaus could easili use addit hour minimum fill gap a result i didnt care charact noth reson emot oh tri best plenti bombast music cue grandios shot troop ship worm end amount far less sum part so said may think gener rate give i appreci least effort given film art design effect cinematographi sound design topnotch too bad rest fell short
"Enjoyed the first dune movie, however the second one was all right but not as good. It was way too long, you should have cut at least 40 minutes off of this thing. Zendaya is a horrible plank of wood actress and if you decreased her screen time to about 10% of what it was, it would have been a better movie. The forced love story added nothing to this film and watching her on screen is irritating to say the least. You could have easily taken out 40 minutes of talking scenes that included her and Paul, and it would have sped the movie up a little bit. Just a note for any future sequels, cut her roll down to next to nothing or remove her character entirely.",enjoy first dune movi howev second one right good it way long cut least minut thing zendaya horribl plank wood actress decreas screen time would better movi the forc love stori ad noth film watch screen irrit say least you could easili taken minut talk scene includ paul would sped movi littl bit just note futur sequel cut roll next noth remov charact entir
Words cannot describe how good this movie really is. Starting off this film is not just your typical action film this film has a Story! It keeps you thinking on what will happen next. It is very suspenseful and action packed. The vilians in this film do a great job they show them in such a dark way that gives them justice that they are a strong villian. Paul as the character was amazing I cannot put it into words on how a good role model and a great leader is. Overall this film is a must watch and it is only to be seen on IMAX because it was designed for it with the aspect ratio. And this film deserves an Oscar for sure.,word cannot describ good movi realli start film typic action film film stori it keep think happen next it suspens action pack the vilian film great job show dark way give justic strong villian paul charact amaz i cannot put word good role model great leader overal film must watch seen imax design aspect ratio and film deserv oscar sure
"Dune 2 Review

The following was my first reaction after watching this film...

It was good, but it was long. I mean it was good, it was good. But it was long. Now I'm not saying I didn't like it, it was good ok? But it was long. Did it need to be that long? Well ok it was a really big story so yeah OK it probably needed to be that long. But it was long, man. But it was good. But it was long. I don't know what my final decision is because you know, it was good. But it was long...

I caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on. Performances were solid all around. The story is well worn. The photography was, well, iconic. But it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces. My god, the lensing was so tight that in one shot the character's eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus. On Imax, we can inspect every pore on his skin.

Overall, there was something more exciting about part one, as we are introduced to the setup. Am intriguing world shot in a iconic way. Engaging characters in energetic scenes. I saw the first part twice in the theatre. I have the DVD at home and have watched it again since. I am not so excited about revisiting part two. I guess it's a kind of phenomena like the Matrix. The first film was very appealing because of it's well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about. But by the second movie, it was already kind of been there, done that. I sort of had the same reaction with The Dark Knight Rises after enjoying the bombastic Dark Knight.

Dune as a story is so popular, George Lucas used it as one of his sources for Star Wars. The chosen one template is very familiar, and it takes larger-than-life filmmaking to make it something that stands out. This comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines. The domiciles in this world are simple but elegant. The costumes are evocative of ancient religions. The music fit as well as it did in part one.

Appropriately, the second movie is simply titled Part Two. For it is more of the same. So the second outing there is less awe to some degree, and more drama, with shots of very very large heads. I'm not knocking this film in any way. I think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault. As an editor, I wouldn't dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together. It is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right. Perhaps if I was the director, I would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit. But I'm sure it wouldn't work as well.

In conclusion, the movie has many good scenes of grandeur, but has more scenes of big faces. Sure, great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available, so that helps. I guess I enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one. Maybe time will change my attitude about Part Two compared to Part One. But for now I will give it a 7 out of 10.",dune review the follow first reaction watch film it good long i mean good good but long now im say i didnt like good ok but long did need long well ok realli big stori yeah ok probabl need long but long man but good but long i dont know final decis know good but long i caught someon sit front check time film slowli slog perform solid around the stori well worn the photographi well icon but seem littl much extrem close up face my god lens tight one shot charact eye focu nose focu on imax inspect everi pore skin overal someth excit part one introduc setup am intrigu world shot icon way engag charact energet scene i saw first part twice theatr i dvd home watch sinc i excit revisit part two i guess kind phenomenon like matrix the first film appeal well craft fantasi world excit learn but second movi alreadi kind done i sort reaction the dark knight rise enjoy bombast dark knight dune stori popular georg luca use one sourc star war the chosen one templat familiar take largerthanlif filmmak make someth stand thi come form depict desert world gargantuan fli machin the domicil world simpl eleg the costum evoc ancient religion the music fit well part one appropri second movi simpli titl part two for so second outing less awe degre drama shot larg head im knock film way i think perhap short attent span fault a editor i wouldnt dare question wisdom peopl put togeth it servic fan classic stori tell right perhap i director i would pick pace dialogu wee littl bit but im sure wouldnt work well in conclus movi mani good scene grandeur scene big face sure great care taken hire attract face avail help i guess i enjoy rollick adventur slightli sedat adventur like one mayb time chang attitud part two compar part one but i give
"How this got it's 12A rating is a miracle. The film has war obviously as it's central theme, but it moves away from your traditional battle scenes with some really dark and unnecessary killings. Strangely enough I felt uneasy and creeped out by the religious tone of the film. It felt very close watching a film about an evil cult. This movie doesn't flow, it's disjointed and unrealistic. I learned nothing and felt tricked that the story still hadn't ended. I didn't enjoy this film at all. Zendaya spends nearly every scene gurning for the camera. Timothee isn't convincing as a strong man to lead or fight. Rebecca is just pouting all the time and creepy as hell. Josh brolin has about 5 minutes of dialogue. Christopher is being propped up by a stick. I could go on but I won't.",how got a rate miracl the film war obvious central theme move away tradit battl scene realli dark unnecessari kill strang enough i felt uneasi creep religi tone film it felt close watch film evil cult thi movi doesnt flow disjoint unrealist i learn noth felt trick stori still hadnt end i didnt enjoy film zendaya spend nearli everi scene gurn camera timothe isnt convinc strong man lead fight rebecca pout time creepi hell josh brolin minut dialogu christoph prop stick i could go i wont
"This movie completely exceeded my expectations. I was captivated by the story, the characters, the world that was built beautifully by Dennis Villeneuve.

I don't want to give too much away, but what I will say is that the last time I experienced such entertainment in a cinema was from watching ""The Dark Knight "". This movie is at that exact same level. I am hooked, and cannot wait to see the next installment. Bring on Dune Part 3.

The cinematography and soundtrack complimented each other like cheese & wine. It helped set the mood to an already incredibly impressive story. This movie was all I could ask for to a sequel to Dune Part 1. Dennis Villeneuve will have me anticipating all of his movies from here on out.

"Hype is such a dangerous thing as it opens the door to tremedous let down. Denis Villeneuves opus is the polar opposite. Beyond expectations is what he and his amazing team have achieved. The Godfather 2 of Dune.. Even better than the first. What struck me so often in this film was though the Dune Novels was the inspiration for so many Syfy stories, novels, films you would expect some amount of.. ""oh I have seen that before"" but in Villeneuve's hands, he delivers originality. I expect the film will do to Films what the Books originally did. Its a master class. It there is any thing to criticize, is the jumps in the story from time to time... But it doesnt matter...because the blanks get filled in. Just like a torture scene or love scene where, not everything is shown... Ur imagination is allowed to do the rest. As for Hans Zimmer's score. Oscar in the bag. He has once again raised the bar on the word Epic.

The depth of the movie is fantastic, you can feel like you are part of something big and you can see the power of words. Plenty of great references to human history. Denis Villeneuve is building a great legacy. This trilogy will probably beat lord of the ring as the best trilogy ever made.

"After falling in love right away with the first Dune, reading the book, waiting two years, and then waiting five months due to the writer's strike, I finally saw Dune Part Two. And let me tell you, if this isn't at least in my top 10 favorite movies of the year, I will be amazed. This is far more than just a worthy sequel. It absolutely surpasses the already spectacular first part. It's a lot more fast paced, with a ton more action. And since we got most of the heavy exposition out of the way in Part One, the film now mostly focuses on letting the visuals tell the story. And what a story it is. Not only is it an awesome sci-fi epic, not only is it a cool revenge tale, but it's the saga of our main character's rise to power coupled with his fall from grace. Paul's journey from refusing to become the Lisan Al Gaib to embracing the moniker and using it to suit his needs is as captivating as it is intense.

The cast does an even better job than the first film. Timothy Chalamet, who was a little bland in Part One, slowly grows into a terrifying presence who perfectly sells Paul's descent into madness. He has solid chemistry with Chani and Zendaya does a great job displaying her love for him and sadness at what he becomes. Javier Bardem goes a little over the top in his belief in Paul, but I never doubt his passion and faith. The new characters are fantastic: Christopher Walken is fun as always as the Emperor and Austin Butler is terrifying as Feyd-Rautha. But, the real star is Rebecca Ferguson. Her development is just as captivating as Paul's and she is downright scary at times.

Visually, the film blows me away. The taste we got of Arrakis in Part One is fully realized here. The Fremen culture is fully explored, shown through Paul and Jessica's eyes as outsiders, and presented through stellar sets. The sound, music, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. The color scheme runs the full gambit from the red and brown of Arrakis to the black, white, and grey of the villains' world. This is also the first film I saw in IMAX where the sound actually lived up to its reputation.

Overall, Dune Part Two was more than worth the wait. I loved every second of it and you can bet I have every intention of buying it when it comes out on Blu-Ray. As for Dune: Messiah, whenever Denis Villeneuve makes it, I'll be right there in the theater to enjoy.",after fall love right away first dune read book wait two year wait five month due writer strike i final saw dune part two and let tell isnt least top favorit movi year i amaz thi far worthi sequel it absolut surpass alreadi spectacular first part it lot fast pace ton action and sinc got heavi exposit way part one film mostli focus let visual tell stori and stori not awesom scifi epic cool reveng tale saga main charact rise power coupl fall grace paul journey refus becom lisan al gaib embrac monik use suit need captiv intens the cast even better job first film timothi chalamet littl bland part one slowli grow terrifi presenc perfectli sell paul descent mad he solid chemistri chani zendaya great job display love sad becom javier bardem goe littl top belief paul i never doubt passion faith the new charact fantast christoph walken fun alway emperor austin butler terrifi feydrautha but real star rebecca ferguson her develop captiv paul downright scari time visual film blow away the tast got arraki part one fulli realiz the fremen cultur fulli explor shown paul jessica eye outsid present stellar set the sound music direct cinematographi fantast the color scheme run full gambit red brown arraki black white grey villain world thi also first film i saw imax sound actual live reput overal dune part two worth wait i love everi second bet i everi intent buy come bluray a dune messiah whenev deni villeneuv make ill right theater enjoy

"No seriously, didn't understand any of it.

Four of us watched, none of us read the books etc, yet all four of us took turns basically every 15 minutes to ask ""is anyone understanding this?"".

It's up there with probably the worst example of cinematic storytelling. As if the director assumed there was no need to explain the incredibly complex parts to the story and not only that, introduced new complexities in such regular fashion that it was simply impossible to keep up.

As others have said, it was quite simply boring. Also, basically monochrome or better yet, sepia tone. Entire movie was purposefully shot in sand tones. No, it didn't feel ""immersive"", just magnified the dull experience.

Acting was also very poor but I'm not focusing there as it's really hard to truly evaluate when you've got no idea what they are talking about to judge how they deliver it.",no serious didnt understand four u watch none u read book etc yet four u took turn basic everi minut ask anyon understand it probabl worst exampl cinemat storytel a director assum need explain incred complex part stori introduc new complex regular fashion simpli imposs keep a other said quit simpli bore also basic monochrom better yet sepia tone entir movi purpos shot sand tone no didnt feel immers magnifi dull experi act also poor im focus realli hard truli evalu youv got idea talk judg deliv
"After waiting a few days to digest... As a fan of Frank Herbert's novels, and Dennis Villenueve's adaptation of Part One, I cannot be happier. While staying faithful to the core of the book, Dennis makes his own path, and increases the intensity and complexity of how powerful this story is. The gripping thrill it brings to the table minute by minute as we see the second half of Herbert's vision come to life was something I could not have imagined, all the actors ARE their characters. The star studded cast only builds on top of each other, and elevate one another at the same time in unison. The directing, editing, cinematography, and overall production of this movie is the reason people go to the movies.

"There were only three things I didn't like. Christopher Walken was horribly miscast; it was like he was dropped in from another movie. All I could see was Christopher Walken, not the character he was portraying. The second miscast was Florence Pugh; it just seems like she's in everything right now, which is probably why I have Pugh fatigue. With her performance, she also seemed a little outside of the Dune universe. Lastly, Glossu Harkonnen got a wicked nerf bat in Part 2, which was a tad strange; in the first, he was perceived as brutal and fearless, and in Part 2, he was a coward and a screw-up. Besides those three critiques, the movie itself was fantastic.",there three thing i didnt like christoph walken horribl miscast like drop anoth movi all i could see christoph walken charact portray the second miscast florenc pugh seem like she everyth right probabl i pugh fatigu with perform also seem littl outsid dune univers lastli glossu harkonnen got wick nerf bat part tad strang first perceiv brutal fearless part coward screwup besid three critiqu movi fantast
"Dune Part 2 delivers a cinematic spectacle like no other. Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends boundaries, crafting an instant classic that immerses viewers in a universe beyond imagination. The film's grand scale and breathtaking visuals set a new standard for epic storytelling. From the very beginning, you're drawn into a world where characters and their identities are expertly primed, making for a deeply engaging narrative.

What truly sets Dune Part 2 apart is its ability to blend depth, scale, drama, spectacle and humor, creating a movie experience that resonates with adult audiences seeking substance and sophistication. It's a refreshing departure from the formulaic tropes of frequent franchises and Hollywood blockbusters, offering a polished cinematic gem destined to withstand the test of time.

The sound design is nothing short of extraordinary, with Hans Zimmer's score elevating every scene to new heights. After watching, you're left with an exhilarating sensation akin to finishing a thrilling ride, a testament to the film's immersive power.

"Nothing can quite prepare you for this feast of the senses. Probably one of the best film sequels ever made, this movie has everything you could possibly ask for. Breathtaking cinematography, great acting, fantastic script, atmospheric film score and beautiful costumery. The story continues from the first film and be prepared from pulse-setting action from the outset. This is more of a fast-moving film from the first, seriously switching the story up a gear. With its stunning and beautiful visual aesthetics, this spell-binding film transports you into another realm with painterly landscapes and seamless sci-fi effects.

"It wasn't as cool as the original. The worm ridding was too cartoonish.

But The lack of the philosophy of the weirding devices that gave tones power to actually obliterate matter.

And how Paul eventually didn't need the devices. I think Made the original so much more dramatic and divine. Like the magic of the force in Star Wars.

Removing it weakened the story and power of the story. Lessening it dramatically to the point all you're left with is a big CGI screen show.

But remakes always seem to lose something.

It's still a better dialogue, written and acted version.

A little more dragging but most movies these days are getting almost too long.",it wasnt cool origin the worm rid cartoonish but the lack philosophi weird devic gave tone power actual obliter matter and paul eventu didnt need devic i think made origin much dramat divin like magic forc star war remov weaken stori power stori lessen dramat point your left big cgi screen show but remak alway seem lose someth it still better dialogu written act version a littl drag movi day get almost long
"This was probably the fastest 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life! I can see where all the hype is coming from, this movie is absolutely amazing! The visuals were beautiful, the music was great, and the acting was amazing, just like in the first film except better. Story-wise, they did make some changes from the book, some of those changes I actually liked and others I thought were a little odd. They also cut out a lot of scenes, plot lines, and entire characters that were present in the book. But wow... this movie is a masterpiece. If this doesn't end up being the best movie of 2024, then we've had a really good year for movies.",thi probabl fastest hour minut life i see hype come movi absolut amaz the visual beauti music great act amaz like first film except better storywis make chang book chang i actual like other i thought littl odd they also cut lot scene plot line entir charact present book but wow movi masterpiec if doesnt end best movi weve realli good year movi
"So I have read the books, watched the previous mini-series and played the many games over the years and I can tell you one thing, it's a good could even be great Si-Fi movies but they failed at the story, the visuals are great, the score is amazing, the design,....etc. But the story was just not there, they missed and changed many details that are imperative to the story, for example where does the spice come from, why does it matter, where is the spacing guild, why don't they have computers in the future, why would the universe stand still if something happened to it's supply! How did the fremen manage to beat those armies especially the dune sardaukar, and what about Alia and her whole arch! The thing is without going into much details how can they take this to cover the rest of the story ""Children of Dune"" & ""God Emperor of Dune""

I felt disappointed by the middle of that movie and it just felt like the last season of GOT all over again, so bottom line, if you know nothing about this story, you will enjoy it and could be a 10 in your book, for me I can give it a 6, or 7 out of 10 at best.",so i read book watch previou miniseri play mani game year i tell one thing good could even great sifi movi fail stori visual great score amaz designetc but stori miss chang mani detail imper stori exampl spice come matter space guild dont comput futur would univers stand still someth happen suppli how fremen manag beat armi especi dune sardaukar alia whole arch the thing without go much detail take cover rest stori child dune god emperor dune i felt disappoint middl movi felt like last season got bottom line know noth stori enjoy could book i give best

"I loved this movie but I don't need to write a whole review like everyone else. Do you book readers that a movie adaptation does not need to have every single thing YOU want from the book. An adaptation is BASED off the book, not an exact copy of it. If they wanted to fit everything we'd have a 5 hour long movie, but we can't add everything, can we? Lower your expectations y'all are embarrassing yourselves. All you're doing is yapping about how much of a fan you are. Let people enjoy the movie ADAPTATION, not the copy you want.

"This movie made me write my first review. It is an engrossing and mesmerising cinematic marvel, on track to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. A perfect sequel, jam-packed equally with epic action and mystical realities, and accompanied by a stellar score from Hans Zimmer, this movie stuck in my head for days after watching it.

As a die hard fan of Dune, seeing the adaptation of Frank Herbert's magnum opus, said to be unadaptable, on the wide screen was a dream come true. The movie is a must watch on the big screen and a treat to behold for fans and casual watchers alike.

"It was an okay movie, but i don't think that it needed to be 3 hours.. A lot of useless scenes in my opinion, and Zendaya looking angry at the camera for 1 and a half hour. In other words, the excessive runtime left me questioning the necessity of a three-hour saga. Numerous scenes felt gratuitous and added little to the overall plot, contributing to a sense of dragging monotony. Zendaya's prolonged stern expressions, seemingly directed at the camera, became a repetitive distraction rather than a compelling element. Overall, the film lacked efficient storytelling, making it an okay experience at best.",it okay movi dont think need hour a lot useless scene opinion zendaya look angri camera half hour in word excess runtim left question necess threehour saga numer scene felt gratuit ad littl overal plot contribut sen drag monotoni zendaya prolong stern express seemingli direct camera becam repetit distract rather compel element overal film lack effici storytel make okay experi best
"The book builds a very large and complicated world, even by science fiction standards. So to even dare to create a film version of it was ambitious from day one. There are so many ways it could go wrong, and so many risks. Part One worked (at least for me). I was apprehensive about Part Two, as I feared it might let me down, or become bogged down in the vast details of the novel, or be yet another victim of film-making by committee so that everything lost its colour and strangeness. That did not happen. This is a special film. It's an intelligent, beautifully made blockbuster. It's an act of devotion for the novels, too.

Dune Part Two is a long, thought-provoking and ambitious film that sets out as a philosophical study of the nature of belief and religion, and manages to be that without losing any of the spectacular visual beauty and drama along the way. It isn't a particularly light or easy film, but it is stunning, and it asks you to pay attention to it fully. It's a serious film. I respect that, because it's a serious book with a serious point to make.

The landscapes are striking and strange. There are thrilling and tense moments. There are also softer moments of intimacy and strong characterisation. I think Lady Jessica particularly comes across as extraordinarily dangerous, manipulative, and without any other options except to be that. Paul is the reluctant messiah who understands that nothing actually compels him to do what the prophecies say, but that at the same time, he will do what the prophecies say, because there is no other way out. His struggles are very well represented and easy to understand, without being over-simplified.

What I did not like, the reason it's a 9 rather than a 10, was that a couple of moments were a little unnaturally segued into, in my opinion. Things seemed to be rather sudden developments on occasion. I also think the ending was good in that it wasn't an ending but just a beginning of a new phase of the story, which fits with the novels and Paul's situation, but it might have left some people rather unsatisfied.",the book build larg complic world even scienc fiction standard so even dare creat film version ambiti day one there mani way could go wrong mani risk part one work least i apprehens part two i fear might let becom bog vast detail novel yet anoth victim filmmak committe everyth lost colour strang that happen thi special film it intellig beauti made blockbust it act devot novel dune part two long thoughtprovok ambiti film set philosoph studi natur belief religion manag without lose spectacular visual beauti drama along way it isnt particularli light easi film stun ask pay attent fulli it seriou film i respect seriou book seriou point make the landscap strike strang there thrill ten moment there also softer moment intimaci strong characteris i think ladi jessica particularli come across extraordinarili danger manipul without option except paul reluct messiah understand noth actual compel propheci say time propheci say way hi struggl well repres easi understand without oversimplifi what i like reason rather coupl moment littl unnatur segu opinion thing seem rather sudden develop occas i also think end good wasnt end begin new phase stori fit novel paul situat might left peopl rather unsatisfi
"The first movie was visually stunning but boring as hell. So basically, the second one was marketed as a masterpiece, best sci-fi movie ever by critics and even compared to best Star Wars movies.

Is it a masterpiece? Or did we watch the same story before in many forms? Matrix maybe? Prophecies, chosen ones and dreams offer same type of premises.

Austin Butler's villian portrayal is nowhere close to Ledger's Joker or Bardem's Chigurh but still PRed agressively as so. Chalamet is a big OK as protagonist. Zendaya is the weakest part actingwise and her California accent doesn't help the spice planet. Villeneuve's directing is maybe flawless but still relies way too much on visual and sound. Zimmer's soundtrack is intense and original as always lifting up scenes one level.

The only difference between Dune and Rebel Moon are a better director and fat studio budget in real. Is it good? Yes, it is but a 7/10 at max. Nothing more.",the first movi visual stun bore hell so basic second one market masterpiec best scifi movi ever critic even compar best star war movi is masterpiec or watch stori mani form matrix mayb propheci chosen one dream offer type premis austin butler villian portray nowher close ledger joker bardem chigurh still pred agress chalamet big ok protagonist zendaya weakest part actingwis california accent doesnt help spice planet villeneuv direct mayb flawless still reli way much visual sound zimmer soundtrack intens origin alway lift scene one level the differ dune rebel moon better director fat studio budget real is good ye max noth
"I cannot even express how incongruent everything is in this movie. Sardaukar and Harkonnens behave like a pile of manekenas, and they even don't know how to use swords or riffles.

Total absurd.

The protagonist looks like he just finished kindergarten. His speech is nonsense.

The final battle is like an army fight against trees.

Baron names the most primitive decision as ingenious one.

The only descent thing in this movie is graphics. Of course, they can do this considering the amount of money.

And this nonsense last 3 hours. They can compress it to 15 min and it would be the same useless pile of scenes.",i cannot even express incongru everyth movi sardaukar harkonnen behav like pile manekena even dont know use sword riffl total absurd the protagonist look like finish kindergarten hi speech nonsens the final battl like armi fight tree baron name primit decis ingeni one the descent thing movi graphic of cours consid amount money and nonsens last hour they compress min would useless pile scene
"A worthy squeal. As with part 1, the cinematography was excellent. The use of scale and angles was a pleasure to the eye. If you are familiar with the novels you will see they are moving the story along well with a little tweaking here and there.

I love Christopher Walken but not sure he needed to be in this film.

The music is as grand as the scenery. And I was not disappointed at all with the worm riding. You could almost feel how hard it must be to do. Great directing and special effects. And the actors and actresses made you feel with them as good performers should.

"You sit in the theater and 2h 46m just rush by. The plot is dense, so many things happen in this movie that it almost feels bit to quickly narrated at times - albeit never ""rushed"". The reason why nothing feels rushed is due to the unparalleled visual spectacle that is Dune: Part Two. Large-scale battles, dense fight scenes, but also sweeping landscape shots and close-up moments between characters are all set into scene so stunningly, I truly think it's the best looking sci-fi movie of all time. And not only the cinematography is breathatking and epic, everything around it is, too: The costumes, the epic soundtrack and, espcially, the sound design. The whole sensory experience is so weighty and well-built.

I also appreicate the daring choices of color grading which give the movie a welcome artistic element.

For me, Dune: Part Two got stronger as it progressed. While some character arcs were told a bit quick, they did make sense in the end and lead to a more-than-epic climax and conclusion. I really hope a Part Three will be greenlit, I feel like I am anything but tired of watching the world of Dune unfold out of Denis Villeneuve's hands.",you sit theater h rush the plot den mani thing happen movi almost feel bit quickli narrat time albeit never rush the reason noth feel rush due unparallel visual spectacl dune part two largescal battl den fight scene also sweep landscap shot closeup moment charact set scene stunningli i truli think best look scifi movi time and cinematographi breathatk epic everyth around the costum epic soundtrack espcial sound design the whole sensori experi weighti wellbuilt i also appreic dare choic color grade give movi welcom artist element for dune part two got stronger progress while charact arc told bit quick make sen end lead morethanep climax conclus i realli hope part three greenlit i feel like i anyth tire watch world dune unfold deni villeneuv hand

The acting, MUSIC, fight scenes, cinematography, the world building and the characters were well thought,everything was on point.

"I found the film entertaining, but was disappointed at the lack of acting. What is the purpose of having a renowned character actor like Christopher Walken, who can captivate his audience with his oratory performances, and not giving him lines to recite? Most of the actress's faces are hidden behind face veils making it almost impossible to see who is really doing the acting. When we do see their faces, we can see nose, eyes and mouth and they are covered by a veil which only allows a shadow of the persons face viewable to the audience. The movie goes to great lengths to de-glamorize the physical beauty of a mature female by covering up all defining physical attributes with outer wear that is similar to Middle Eastern desert dress. The fighting scenes tend to be bloodless, in fact almost all the blood is replace with water or blue stuff. It seems this film went to the extremes to comply with the PG-13 rating. Why? The strange thing about the film is how it relates to religious fanatics and war and in the end we have a holy war. Why? Seems the whole fuss was about the blue stuff and nothing to do with religion, except for the fact that the blue stuffs home planet is populated by a very religious majority. The root cause from all the fighting is the pursuit of power and wealth that comes from controlling the blue stuff. So why not just tell the story from the point of view of a greed and power struggle and give: the actors some decent line to recite, not covering up the females and their physical beauty, show some blood in the fighting and maybe some intimate love making might help? Bottom line is that you can only look at a sea of sand for so long, and three hours is way over my limit.",i found film entertain disappoint lack act what purpos renown charact actor like christoph walken captiv audienc oratori perform give line recit most actress face hidden behind face veil make almost imposs see realli act when see face see nose eye mouth cover veil allow shadow person face viewabl audienc the movi goe great length deglamor physic beauti matur femal cover defin physic attribut outer wear similar middl eastern desert dress the fight scene tend bloodless fact almost blood replac water blue stuff it seem film went extrem compli pg rate whi the strang thing film relat religi fanat war end holi war whi seem whole fuss blue stuff noth religion except fact blue stuff home planet popul religi major the root caus fight pursuit power wealth come control blue stuff so tell stori point view greed power struggl give actor decent line recit cover femal physic beauti show blood fight mayb intim love make might help bottom line look sea sand long three hour way limit

The craft is expertly made, and it shows in every shot, every note of the score, and every scene that transports the audience to Arrakis.

"""Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, encapsulating the essence of Frank Herbert's classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction, elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion, where the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the intricate complexities of Herbert's universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depth.

The visuals in ""Dune: Part Two"" are nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve, along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves. Each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece, capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape, the opulence of the imperial court, and the visceral intensity of the Fremen's struggle. The use of practical effects, augmented by judicious CGI, creates a tactile realism that grounds the story's fantastical elements in a palpable reality. The sweeping shots of Arrakis's desert, the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology, and the hauntingly beautiful Sietches of the Fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own right.

Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary. His music for ""Dune: Part Two"" is both haunting and evocative, weaving traditional Middle Eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the film's themes of destiny, power, and transformation. The score ebbs and flows with the narrative, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments, from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy. Zimmer's ability to capture the soul of Herbert's universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle, ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply moving.

For fans of the original novels, ""Dune: Part Two"" offers a nuanced interpretation of Paul Atreides' journey that both honors and challenges Herbert's intentions. In the books, particularly in ""Dune Messiah,"" Herbert sought to subvert the traditional hero's journey by presenting Paul as a deeply flawed figure, whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering. This film bravely embraces that complexity, depicting Paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy, the seductions of power, and the moral ambiguities of his actions.

This portrayal of Paul is a bold narrative choice, reflecting a deeper understanding of Herbert's critique of the hero myth. By emphasizing Paul's darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions, ""Dune: Part Two"" challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership, heroism, and destiny. It's a testament to Timothée Chalamet's performance that Paul remains a compelling, if increasingly troubled, protagonist. Chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire, bringing a nuanced depth to Paul that is both captivating and unsettling.

The decision to delve into the darker aspects of Paul's character aligns with Herbert's own reflections on the misinterpretation of ""Dune."" Herbert was concerned that readers glorified Paul as a hero, missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls. This film rectifies that, presenting a vision of Paul that is more in line with Herbert's intentions, and in doing so, enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguity.

""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of Villeneuve's adaptation, a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of Herbert's universe but also engages with its most challenging themes. The combination of stunning visuals, a captivating score, and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement. It's a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power, heroism, and the human condition, solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking.",dune part two emerg cinemat tour de forc encapsul essenc frank herbert classic execut describ visual auditori mesmer director deni villeneuv vision transcend confin tradit scienc fiction elev film realm unparallel immers desol beauti arraki intric complex herbert univers brought life stagger clariti emot depth the visual dune part two noth short breathtak villeneuv along cinematograph greig fraser craft visual palett vast sweep dune each frame meticul design masterpiec captur stark beauti desert landscap opul imperi court viscer intens fremen struggl the use practic effect augment judici cgi creat tactil realism ground stori fantast element palpabl realiti the sweep shot arrakiss desert intric design spaceship technolog hauntingli beauti sietch fremen render detail care becom charact right han zimmer score complement visual creat immers experi truli extraordinari hi music dune part two haunt evoc weav tradit middl eastern motif futurist synth underscor film theme destini power transform the score ebb flow narr amplifi emot reson key moment thunder clash battl intim whisper propheci zimmer abil captur soul herbert univers composit add layer depth film transcend visual spectacl ensnar audienc sensori embrac exhilar deepli move for fan origin novel dune part two offer nuanc interpret paul atreid journey honor challeng herbert intent in book particularli dune messiah herbert sought subvert tradit hero journey present paul deepli flaw figur whose rise power bring salvat suffer thi film brave embrac complex depict paul unblemish hero mani come expect young man grappl weight propheci seduct power moral ambigu action thi portray paul bold narr choic reflect deeper understand herbert critiqu hero myth by emphas paul darker impuls consequ decis dune part two challeng viewer reconsid percept leadership heroism destini it testament timoth chalamet perform paul remain compel increasingli troubl protagonist chalamet captur intern conflict charact caught destini desir bring nuanc depth paul captiv unsettl the decis delv darker aspect paul charact align herbert reflect misinterpret dune herbert concern reader glorifi paul hero miss cautionari tale power pitfal thi film rectifi present vision paul line herbert intent enrich narr complex ambigu dune part two master continu villeneuv adapt film captur grandeur majesti herbert univers also engag challeng theme the combin stun visual captiv score willing explor moral complex protagonist make film remark achiev it cinemat experi entertain also invit reflect natur power heroism human condit solidifi place landmark scienc fiction filmmak
"Dune Part 2 is truly amazing in terms of story, music, visuals and characters. The film is almost 3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it because the storyline is not boring and each character is also not wasted. A masterpiece in the midst of superhero films that are starting to get bored and have no clear direction. As a sequel dune 2 starts the story without missing a beat. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), continue their adventure on the desert planet Arrakis.

Out of the clutches of the Harkonnen, they try to join the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), who appeared several times in Paul's dreams in the first film. As Paul tries to understand their customs, Lady Jessica tells the Fremen that her son is the leader they have been waiting for according to the prophecy.

Denis Villeneuve succeeded in presenting perfect details. The worlds he creates are stunning, from the desert of Arrakis to majestic palaces. The appearance of giant sandworms and neatly choreographed battle scenes are entertainment for those who enjoy the sci-fi action genre. Villeneuve succeeded in transforming the visuals from Frank Herbert's novel beautifully in every scene.

Dune 2 also presents deep and interesting characters. Timothee Chalamet takes Paul Atreides to new heights with a compelling performance, just the right amount of charismatic and intimidating, conveying the complexity of Paul's character ideally. Zendaya, who previously only appeared a few times in Dune: Part One, now has the opportunity to explore Chani's character as a strong and brave figure.

The presence of supporting roles such as Lady Jessica and Princess Irula (Florence Pugh) also adds to the complexity of the political complexities in the world created by Villeneuve. Javier Bardem as Stilgar also gave an extraordinary performance that will stick in the audience's memory. Likewise, Austin Butler, who previously impressed through Elvis (2022), again displays his eccentric and memorable role.",dune part truli amaz term stori music visual charact the film almost hour long doesnt feel like storylin bore charact also wast a masterpiec midst superhero film start get bore clear direct a sequel dune start stori without miss beat paul atreid timothe chalamet mother ladi jessica rebecca ferguson continu adventur desert planet arraki out clutch harkonnen tri join fremen includ chani zendaya appear sever time paul dream first film a paul tri understand custom ladi jessica tell fremen son leader wait accord propheci deni villeneuv succeed present perfect detail the world creat stun desert arraki majest palac the appear giant sandworm neatli choreograph battl scene entertain enjoy scifi action genr villeneuv succeed transform visual frank herbert novel beauti everi scene dune also present deep interest charact timothe chalamet take paul atreid new height compel perform right amount charismat intimid convey complex paul charact ideal zendaya previous appear time dune part one opportun explor chani charact strong brave figur the presenc support role ladi jessica princess irula florenc pugh also add complex polit complex world creat villeneuv javier bardem stilgar also gave extraordinari perform stick audienc memori likewis austin butler previous impress elvi display eccentr memor role
"From the moment the opening credits rolled, it was clear that ""Dune Part Two"" wasn't just a continuation-it was a transcendental elevation of the saga. Director Denis Villeneuve has outdone himself, weaving a tapestry so rich in detail and emotion that it's hard not to be completely engulfed by the world of Arrakis.

The narrative depth in this sequel is profound, striking a perfect balance between the political intrigue, personal vendettas, and the overarching battle for control of the spice. The storytelling is nuanced, with each character's journey feeling both intimate and monumental in the grand scheme of the Dune universe. Timothée Chalamet's return as Paul Atreides is nothing short of mesmerizing. His portrayal of Paul's evolution from a boy burdened by prophecy to a leader embroiled in desert warfare is executed with a depth and vulnerability that's rarely seen in science fiction epics.

The newcomers to the cast bring fresh dynamics that enhance the story in unexpected ways, blending seamlessly with the returning ensemble to create a rich tapestry of characters. Zendaya's Chani is given much more room to shine, offering a poignant and fierce performance that stands as the emotional core of the film.

Visually, ""Dune Part Two"" is a feast for the senses. The cinematography captures the vast, unforgiving landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty, while the set designs and costumes further immerse the audience in this otherworldly experience. The action sequences are choreographed with a clarity and scale that surpass the already high bar set by the first film, making every battle both a spectacle and a crucial piece of the narrative puzzle.

Hans Zimmer's score, once again, elevates the film to new heights. His compositions blend.",from moment open credit roll clear dune part two wasnt continuationit transcendent elev saga director deni villeneuv outdon weav tapestri rich detail emot hard complet engulf world arraki the narr depth sequel profound strike perfect balanc polit intrigu person vendetta overarch battl control spice the storytel nuanc charact journey feel intim monument grand scheme dune univers timoth chalamet return paul atreid noth short mesmer hi portray paul evolut boy burden propheci leader embroil desert warfar execut depth vulner that rare seen scienc fiction epic the newcom cast bring fresh dynam enhanc stori unexpect way blend seamlessli return ensembl creat rich tapestri charact zendaya chani given much room shine offer poignant fierc perform stand emot core film visual dune part two feast sen the cinematographi captur vast unforgiv landscap arraki breathtak beauti set design costum immers audienc otherworldli experi the action sequenc choreograph clariti scale surpass alreadi high bar set first film make everi battl spectacl crucial piec narr puzzl han zimmer score elev film new height hi composit blend
"I went into this movie thinking Dune Part One was a masterpiece so I already knew I'd love this film. Dune Part Two took everything people liked in the first one and multiplied it x1000. This must have been what people felt like walking out of Star Wars in 1977. This is our generation's Star Wars. Denis Villeneuve is a technical genius and I loved everything about this film. The world building in this one is even better than the first, the cinematography somehow got even better, the acting is top tier, but once again what shines the most is the score. Hearing that music again but this time on the silver screen was a feeling that won't be replicated in a long while. Walking out of this movie I felt like I was Paul Muad'dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis. This is what movies are made for. My hopes are through the roof for Dune Messiah.

"""Dune: Part 2"" is a big-budget film, filmed in co-production between 8 countries: the United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Jordan, New Zealand, Italy and the Gambia, resulting in an extraordinary production of great proportions. The cast is top-notch and gives remarkable performances, Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, Christopher Walken, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin shine in every scene demonstrating their histrionic abilities. Denis Villeneuve's work as a director is excellent, demonstrating his talent behind the cameras. The adaptation of the chapters taken to film from the book ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert are scripted by Denis Villeneuve himself together with Jon Spaihts, resulting in an epic story, although in some scenes it becomes long and in others it becomes very precipitated. The technical elements such as cinematography, sound design, costume design, editing and special effects are majestically achieved and are a visual delight. Although ""Dune: Part 2"" is a great film, it falls short of being a complete masterpiece and despite the critical praise that considers it superior to its predecessor, that is exaggerated. As a result the film is incredible and visually stunning.",dune part bigbudget film film coproduct countri unit state canada unit arab emir hungari jordan new zealand itali gambia result extraordinari product great proport the cast topnotch give remark perform timoth chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson florenc pugh austin butler javier bardem christoph walken charlott rampl stellan skarsgrd dave bautista josh brolin shine everi scene demonstr histrion abil deni villeneuv work director excel demonstr talent behind camera the adapt chapter taken film book dune frank herbert script deni villeneuv togeth jon spaiht result epic stori although scene becom long other becom precipit the technic element cinematographi sound design costum design edit special effect majest achiev visual delight although dune part great film fall short complet masterpiec despit critic prais consid superior predecessor exagger a result film incred visual stun
You can only omit so much you lose a lot of the meaning in the book. I wonder if they even read the book. The David lynch version is far better than this one. The acting was decent. The special effects especially the sandworm was poor. If you read the book you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book please do it us not this junk. Pual's sister isn't even born at the start of the war. I think the director has misinterpreted the entire story. They plan on doing children of dune. I wish they would not do it.

"Just walked out of the IMAX theater (A must-see format btw), and I was so blown away by the rigor of this film. Incredible adaptation of the screenplay, stacked cast and jaw-dropping cinematography on every frame. One highlight though, is the level of emotion that are being played within the film is insane. It's an experience.

Is it confusing? Even though the movie touched on Herbert's idea of politics and religion, but Denis carried us through seamlessly. Not even a boring part exists, as I believe that there are more difficult and challenging materials. Dune part two nailed the storyline for me.

Please go watch and experience this since you won't get to see this kinds of movie often.",just walk imax theater a mustse format btw i blown away rigor film incred adapt screenplay stack cast jawdrop cinematographi everi frame one highlight though level emot play within film insan it experi is confus even though movi touch herbert idea polit religion deni carri u seamlessli not even bore part exist i believ difficult challeng materi dune part two nail storylin plea go watch experi sinc wont get see kind movi often
"Sample review : This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.

Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.

Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering.

"When I saw the first movie I could tell it was many used to build up to this one and it showed. Dune 2 is one of my favorite movies, it could just be that I love sci-fi, but there is really nothing to complain about. My favorite movie is Interstellar, even though this movie is very different; they both involve space and I love the genre. A strongpoint of this movie is the soundtrack and cinematography. Which is also a strongpoint of Interstellar. I will probably see this movie many more times on streaming. I will also see Dune: Messiah as soon as it comes out. I totally recommend this movie to anyone.",when i saw first movi i could tell mani use build one show dune one favorit movi could i love scifi realli noth complain my favorit movi interstellar even though movi differ involv space i love genr a strongpoint movi soundtrack cinematographi which also strongpoint interstellar i probabl see movi mani time stream i also see dune messiah soon come i total recommend movi anyon
"Quite possibly the easiest rating I will have to give to any movie that comes out this year. Not only is Dune Part 2 better than it's predecessor it is better than any Si-Fi movie in the last 10 years with the narrow and arguable exception to Interstellar. If this does not speak to the magnitude of Dune Part 2 then I don't know what does because for a Si-Fi action film this is as good as it gets almost perfect with nothing I would change as the viewer some ideas of this would be the actors the use of visual affects and CGI in certain areas of the film, and even the casting was unarguable.

First of all, I would like to shed light on Austin Butler, because not only was he incredible and honestly a surprise; he was absolutely terrifying, this guy made any Star-Wars villain look like a stuffed animal, if only Dune part 2 came out a few months earlier because Austin Butler would have for sure been a front runner for best supporting actor because he was just breath taking and defiantly a star in a bright room.

With Austin Butler being my stand out actor I still have to mention Timothee Chalamet because again he was unbelievable on the same level as Austin Butler contrary to my earlier comments, what makes me believe this is the passion and anger in his voice was just bone chilling and almost any scene where he was ready to make a decision sent shivers down my spine because all of the plot was falling into place but it was just amplified that much more with incredible acting.

Now with my actors concluded I must talk about the CGI and visual affects because Dune Part 2 would be little without them. All I can say is WOW!!! The visual affects made Star-wars and Avatar look cheap and that is saying something considering it had nowhere near as much funding and budget I mean even the scenes with the sand worms where perfect and could not look any more realistic but I can't leave it there because it doesn't stop there, the space ship although other worldly still looked like they where one hundred percent real. Dune Part 2 really was a stunning spectacle for the eyes.

And for the best part of Dune Part 2, the cinematography was some of the best you will ever see in your life and I mean it no movie of film ever comes remotely near especially in the Si-Fi genre which speaks to how incredible Dune Part 2 is. Even the black and white shots looked stunning and sharper than a knife no matter what you end up watching this on it will still look beautiful. One scene in particular that stood out which was when Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler where fighting and the camara was set horizontally perpendicular to where they where fighting and the sun was symmetrical to the middle of the screen and the glare of the sun broke out into the audience, in short because I could talk about this one scene for hours , it was one of the greatest and most captivating scenes in any movie in history, truly amazing. There is so much more to cover with the cinematography but I don't have space or time but honestly you could watch Dune Part 2 just for the cinematography and you would be impressed.

It doesn't matter if you believe in the prophesy or not because one thing I can say is that Dune Part 2 is a special movie and one that does not come by very often so it needs to be appreciated because there are so many factors that make this a perfect film on it's own and a perfect sequel because facing facts it is better than Dune Part 1 but it is also better than any other movie you will go and see this year, What I am trying to say is that it will take something very special to top Dune Part 2. And with that I cannot wait for Part 3 because I am sure they will do an even better job than what has already been done, goodbye and go and watch Dune Part 2 I implore you an easy 10 out of 10.",quit possibl easiest rate i give movi come year not dune part better predecessor better sifi movi last year narrow arguabl except interstellar if speak magnitud dune part i dont know sifi action film good get almost perfect noth i would chang viewer idea would actor use visual affect cgi certain area film even cast unargu first i would like shed light austin butler incred honestli surpris absolut terrifi guy made starwar villain look like stuf anim dune part came month earlier austin butler would sure front runner best support actor breath take defiantli star bright room with austin butler stand actor i still mention timothe chalamet unbeliev level austin butler contrari earlier comment make believ passion anger voic bone chill almost scene readi make decis sent shiver spine plot fall place amplifi much incred act now actor conclud i must talk cgi visual affect dune part would littl without all i say wow the visual affect made starwar avatar look cheap say someth consid nowher near much fund budget i mean even scene sand worm perfect could look realist i cant leav doesnt stop space ship although worldli still look like one hundr percent real dune part realli stun spectacl eye and best part dune part cinematographi best ever see life i mean movi film ever come remot near especi sifi genr speak incred dune part even black white shot look stun sharper knife matter end watch still look beauti one scene particular stood timothe chalamet austin butler fight camara set horizont perpendicular fight sun symmetr middl screen glare sun broke audienc short i could talk one scene hour one greatest captiv scene movi histori truli amaz there much cover cinematographi i dont space time honestli could watch dune part cinematographi would impress it doesnt matter believ prophesi one thing i say dune part special movi one come often need appreci mani factor make perfect film perfect sequel face fact better dune part also better movi go see year what i tri say take someth special top dune part and i cannot wait part i sure even better job alreadi done goodby go watch dune part i implor easi

the other half was weak inconsequential dialogue of no substance i.e. ""genius we are melting rock on them"" says the Barron completely out of character and for no reason at all

"Long time Dune fan. Read the books as a kid, watched the movies over the years.

And this one cements Denis Villeneuve as the proper custodian for this tale this time around.

The actors are amazing, even though i'm still a bit on the fence about Timothy.

The score is perfect. It along with the visuals truly makes this movie so perfect.

But what truly sold me, was when watching it in the theater, and the worm ride scene came on.

I caught myself moving and squinting, like i was there in the scene.

It was glorious. A must have experience that can only be delivered on the big screen.

Sure the movie changes some things, but i don't mind as i feel that is to ensure a more fulfilling 3rd part.

"It's rare that I walk out of the theatre *more* excited about a film than I was going in. Especially when my anticipation was already so high. But Villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of Arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting go.

That's not to deny its flaws. It's probably a bit too long. Some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves. Some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity, but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues. It hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguous.

All of that is nit-picking however. The film manages to combine multiple plot lines, character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going. It's true to the broad strokes (and some of the smaller ones) of Frank Herbert's vision, but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago. Every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful sci-fi epic. For once, the cliche that watching a film in a cinema (with the largest screen you can get to) is an 'experience' rings true.",it rare i walk theatr excit film i go especi anticip alreadi high but villeneuv crew absolut pull mesmeris masterpiec pull surfac arraki push religi revolut without ever let go that deni flaw it probabl bit long some charact turn caricatur some deviat book clearli done breviti other seriou deviat sure major ramif stori continu it hit littl hard nose core messag religion great power moral ambigu all nitpick howev the film manag combin multipl plot line charact develop world build without sacrif pace reli fight scene keep momentum go it true broad stroke smaller one frank herbert vision perfectli access someon saw part one year ago everi piec film make craft come togeth beauti scifi epic for clich watch film cinema largest screen get experi ring true
"Permit me to start off by saying this film was so beautifully introduced by the first one. I had anxiety when it was nearing completion because it would be over. Villeneuve once again tells a story using sound, vibrations, colour and technology in a flawless way. The performances by Chalamet, Zendaya, and Skaarsgard were impeccable. The performance that stood out for me was Butlers, I genuinely feared his character and he made me uncomfortable (of course, coupled with Villeneuves art). I would recommend anyone to watch this, it's a beautiful story that is told so well.

"This Film Is very Good.

We Need it to Improve the Hollywood Cinema in the Top of Cinema. The first half of Dune: Part Two is among the best things that Villeneuve has ever done, though the sheer eventfulness of the plot and a bustling retinue of side-players (Austin Butler upgrading Sting's cod-pieced ninny from the 1984 film into a hairless psychopath is worthy of mention) means that the final act does feel rushed.

Dune: Part Two is certainly up there with some of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen.

Villeneuve's facility with this stuff doesn't just come from his talent for spectacle, though there are set pieces in Dune: Part Two that aim to blow the top of your skull off.",thi film is good we need improv hollywood cinema top cinema the first half dune part two among best thing villeneuv ever done though sheer event plot bustl retinu sideplay austin butler upgrad sting codpiec ninni film hairless psychopath worthi mention mean final act feel rush dune part two certainli best scienc fiction movi ive ever seen villeneuv facil stuff doesnt come talent spectacl though set piec dune part two aim blow top skull

That said, the film was a bit long, and despite a few slow moments, it kept us fully engaged, and felt and thrallingly real, despite its other-worldly characters and planets.

"A cinematic masterpiece. Dune 2 is spectacular in every way. From the world building to the character development, everything was perfect, just as I had imagined it when I read the books. Every actor brought their A-game and, although I wasn't overly fond of Timothee as Paul in Dune 1, he did an amazing job this time. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was even more menacing than in the books. Even for people who have not read the series, Denis explained as much as he could without taking away from the film, especially Bene Gesserit customs. Praise to Denis for his homage to the world of Frank Herbert. A monumental achievement.

"The scenery, the costumes, the performances of some the actors are excellent. However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.

It's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.

Oh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.

On that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.

It follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.

All in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low.

"One of the best movies of the decade. Im talking empire strikes back level great. Fantastic writing, acting, worldbuilding, dialogue, action sequences, cinematography, production design and more. Its also thematically rich and features nuanced and multilayered, complex characters. Even in the first 5 minutes I knew it would be even better than the first (the first is still amazing btw.

The score is flawless and the sound design is unique and exquisite. I really don't have any issues with this movie. I guess my only minor qualm would be that we barely got any screentime with florence pughs and Christopher Walkkens characters and it could've been pretty cool if we dived into their politics and storyline a tad more. Anyhow im sure we will see it more in Dune Messiah fingers crossed it happens.

"I'll start by saying that it's been a long time since a movie left me breathless like this. Such exquisite work, such delicacy and dedication could only result in a film that will leave its mark for a long, long time. As soon as the movie ends, it's hard to decide whether I want to watch it all over again or if I need a sequel. Dune 2 is a beautiful example that hard work and talent always pay off. I find it difficult to write about what I liked because I'm still ecstatic about what I saw. The character development works very well, especially with Paul and his mother's arc. The meticulously crafted art direction and photography, the sound design aimed at deeper immersion, the choreography of the fights is excellent, but what truly captivates us is the perfect work of director Denis Villeneuve who, unsurprisingly, hits the mark once again. A simply incredible film and worth every second.",ill start say long time sinc movi left breathless like such exquisit work delicaci dedic could result film leav mark long long time a soon movi end hard decid whether i want watch i need sequel dune beauti exampl hard work talent alway pay i find difficult write i like im still ecstat i saw the charact develop work well especi paul mother arc the meticul craft art direct photographi sound design aim deeper immers choreographi fight excel truli captiv u perfect work director deni villeneuv unsurprisingli hit mark a simpli incred film worth everi second
"Finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scale.

A masterclass in filmmaking by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings the complex universe of Dune to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.

The cinematography is a visual feast, with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.

Furthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer elevates the entire experience, perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrative.

"The film ends in a different way compared to the book. Frank Herbert didn't want to portray Paul as a hero, but the anti-hero. And that's exactly what this film does with the altered end. Paul simply goes too far.

There are bits which are rushed, but in general it has a nice pacing, the characters are believable, the actors are very good, and there's not a single moment in this film that made me feel bored or tired. It's an engaging experience from beginning to end.

The way the story is laid out also doesn't patronise the viewer and doesn't dumb down the plot, which I like.

There's no woke agenda here, no inclusivity pandering, no mischaracterised masculinity, no politics besides the one that's part of the Dune universe. It's a plain, good old-fashioned science fiction story with a healthy dose of drama.

"Better than the first even, for me. It's neat that with Paul's omnipresence, you could think of this as just another permutation in the multiverse that has played out. And the updates are very welcome. The Baron from the previous film. More autonomy for the women, reflecting more overtly the culture, and some much larger implications around the children of dune too. The baby is not yet born, but in the books by the time the showdown happens, it's been quite a few years. Also, Chani is very different. I like that I don't know what will happen next, despite reading the two trilogies.

One thing that does bug me, though, is not including the water ceremony for Jamis, killed in the previous movie, so not a spoiler. The absolute best part of the book is Paul having to carry Jami's water afterward, and the ceremony where people remember him, in which Paul says: I was a friend of Jamis. He taught me that when you kill, you pay for it. And when he cries, people say He Gives Water To the Dead.

For a more... moral Paul being portrayed in the movie, it's wild they didn't include it. It's a powerful moment.",better first even it neat paul omnipres could think anoth permut multivers play and updat welcom the baron previou film more autonomi woman reflect overtli cultur much larger implic around child dune the babi yet born book time showdown happen quit year also chani differ i like i dont know happen next despit read two trilog one thing bug though includ water ceremoni jami kill previou movi spoiler the absolut best part book paul carri jami water afterward ceremoni peopl rememb paul say i friend jami he taught kill pay and cri peopl say he give water to dead for moral paul portray movi wild didnt includ it power moment

"Dune: Part 2 is worth a watch. Multiple watches even. On the biggest screen with the best sound available. It is pure IMAX wonder. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music and sound eerie and unsettling at all the appropriate moments, the direction is wonderful, and the characterization brilliant, the plot follows the spirit of the books. If you are a fan of the books, there are certain critiques to be had, which are valid from a fan who knows what they're talking about. However, if you are to introduce a newbie to Dune...Part 1 and Part 2 here are a great way to do so. I can't imagine how many people will read the Dune series because of this film. Watching Paul's character arc is worthwhile and satisfying and the main thread of the film. The supporting cast/characters arguably steal the show, which says a lot about them because Chalamet did wonderfully. And yes, all the disappointed Zendaya fans from Part 1 for her lack of screen time, you get to see more of Zendaya in this one. There are twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing and even leave you feeling deeply unsettled because, well, that's Dune's story. The fight scenes have intense tension, characterization, storytelling, and drama. This movie is a classic in the making, and a sight to behold!

"A summary of my 2021 DUNE PART 1 Review: The reason to see this is its looks. It is - I apologize - a feast for the eyes. Plot-wise we've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral: 'Spice'. We have a good son with a mysterious mother, we've got evil villains (Harkonnens), and a rebel army (Fremen) with pet worms standing guard. Even so, better to lower your expectations. The giant worms ain't that much. The bald villains are too easy confused with one another. David Bautista is the one recognized villain, but he's weak in his role. The film is somber, morbid, heavy; not a light moment throughout its long running time.

DUNE PART 2 is better. First, the plot is more compelling. The reasons for events in Part 1 are explained here. There is a love angle between the good son Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and a young Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya) which relieves the solemnity. In fact the very presence of Zendaya's character lifts the film mightily; she is without question someone to care about.

Javier Bardem is great as the leader of The Fremen. Josh Brolin is rousing as Chalamet's protector. Austin Butler as the psychopathic next-in-line for the throne receives an A+ for creepiness (a compliment). Christopher Walken is wasted as the Emperor who is, no pun, wasting away. Why he was chosen for this role beats me. Florence Pugh as his daughter is simply 'there'. Her character is a sometimes narrator; the 'sometimes' element simply confusing. Overall there is an aura of self-importance about Dune 2, as though the viewer will take away an important lesson. But again, the heaviness, the weight of the characters' unhappiness, overpowers the 'good' that might be derived.

In Part 2 many of these characters have secrets, as well as secret motives, though I, for one, was never quite sure about whose motives (with the exception of Chani's) were worth rooting for. The special effects here were disappointing; the worms were an improvement over Part 1, though seriously, I wanted to see more of them; ascertain how large they are, see them compared to other large structures. But no. I was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft; they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyance.

Bottom line: Part 2 is a good film. However, I'd be perfectly fine if there were no Part 3.",a summari dune part review the reason see look it i apolog feast eye plotwis weve got war intergalact famili fight right univers import miner spice we good son mysteri mother weve got evil villain harkonnen rebel armi fremen pet worm stand guard even better lower expect the giant worm aint much the bald villain easi confus one anoth david bautista one recogn villain he weak role the film somber morbid heavi light moment throughout long run time dune part better first plot compel the reason event part explain there love angl good son paul atreid timothe chalamet young fremen woman chani zendaya reliev solemn in fact presenc zendaya charact lift film mightili without question someon care javier bardem great leader the fremen josh brolin rous chalamet protector austin butler psychopath nextinlin throne receiv a creepi compliment christoph walken wast emperor pun wast away whi chosen role beat florenc pugh daughter simpli her charact sometim narrat sometim element simpli confus overal aura selfimport dune though viewer take away import lesson but heavi weight charact unhappi overpow good might deriv in part mani charact secret well secret motiv though i one never quit sure whose motiv except chani worth root the special effect disappoint worm improv part though serious i want see ascertain larg see compar larg structur but i never enthusiast interstellar spacecraft appear like deck play card speedi convey bottom line part good film howev id perfectli fine part

I see elements and influences of Star Wars, Gladiator, Mad Max, Metropolis, and Triumph of the Will. The black and white scenes in this are pure excellence. Beautifully horrifying. The last Dune won six Oscars. Same crew this time. Some may not buy the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya and that's fair but the cast overall is a fantasy for many of us.

"For all its stunning visuals and action scenes, Dune: Part 2 is, more than anything else, about people-the grand inter-house politics of the Imperium, the outsiders among the insular Fremen, the believers in prophecy versus the younger self-reliant generation. But at its core, the movie is about motherhood and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect and uplift her child.

Littered with lingering landscape shots of Arakkis, the movie pays respect to the planet that gives both the Fremen and the galaxy life, its most valuable resource being spice. But much like a planet raises and nurtures people, giving them the space and protection to grow and learn for themselves while also guiding them with and through challenges-sandstorms and scalding hot days-Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (now Reverend Mother) guides Paul's life, shaping the path she set when she first decided to have a son rather than a daughter.

And as much as the power of belief has the potential to corrupt Paul, causing countless deaths across the galaxy, the unconditional love of Jessica for Paul is itself a use of power, a transference of opportunity and protection that confers advantages onto its recipient. Jessica, so confident that her son is the Kwisatz Hadarach, she used the myths that the Bene Gessirit planted in Arrakis to propel Paul into leadership of the Fremen-a substantial feat given that both she and Paul are off-worlders and relatively new to Fremen society. In addition, in both the first and second films, Jessica physically protects Paul while simultaneously training him, using those moments to instruct Paul on how to better himself. Ultimately, it is this belief in her son, training in her ways, and protection as he reaches his potential that allows Paul best Feyd-Rautha and usurp the throne.

Spice may be the most valuable substance in the galaxy, but belief is the most powerful source in the Dune universe. But more than a struggling population's belief in a savior, the belief of a parent in their child has truly transformational consequences. In that way, Paul may be the dagger of change, plunged directly into the heart of the Imperium, but Jessica is the knife wielder, living up to her role as a Bene Gessirit, controlling everything from behind the scenes. And it is that same power that she will grant to her unborn daughter when the story continues.",for stun visual action scene dune part anyth el peopleth grand interhous polit imperium outsid among insular fremen believ propheci versu younger selfreli gener but core movi motherhood length mother go protect uplift child litter linger landscap shot arakki movi pay respect planet give fremen galaxi life valuabl resourc spice but much like planet rais nurtur peopl give space protect grow learn also guid challengessandstorm scald hot dayspaul mother ladi jessica reverend mother guid paul life shape path set first decid son rather daughter and much power belief potenti corrupt paul caus countless death across galaxi uncondit love jessica paul use power transfer opportun protect confer advantag onto recipi jessica confid son kwisatz hadarach use myth bene gessirit plant arraki propel paul leadership fremena substanti feat given paul offworld rel new fremen societi in addit first second film jessica physic protect paul simultan train use moment instruct paul better ultim belief son train way protect reach potenti allow paul best feydrautha usurp throne spice may valuabl substanc galaxi belief power sourc dune univers but struggl popul belief savior belief parent child truli transform consequ in way paul may dagger chang plung directli heart imperium jessica knife wielder live role bene gessirit control everyth behind scene and power grant unborn daughter stori continu
"NOTE: I am more or less combining the two movies in one review since it really is one movie in two installments, similar to the Lord of the Rings movies by Peter Jackson.

The short of it is, these two movies will go down in history as two of the greatest SF/Fantasy movies of all time. These films capture the feel of the novel as not just SF about highly-advanced technology but also about sophisticated societies and mysticism which puts it into the realm of science fantasy as it is sometimes called, similar to ""Star Wars"". Simultaneously, the movie has a superb balance between awe-inspiring wars and the emotions of the main characters. The best description might be the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov meets Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.

When ""Dune"" written by Frank Herbert was published in 1965 by Chilton, a publisher mainly of auto repair book manuals no less, nothing like it had ever appeared in SF before. It wasn't only the scope, the action taking place among several politically and culturally sophisticated societies on a planet called Arrakis aka Dune. Some of the novels by Robert Heinlein did have some similar elements. But Herbert brought a new depth which had yet to be explored in SF.

Herbert combined several elements which had rarely (if ever) been assembled in a single SF novel before.

First, a galactic political structure inspired by the Italian city-states of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The galaxy is run by an Emperor and twelve noble houses, and the rivalry between the Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen form the core of the events. Paul Atreides, the central character, is the son of Duke Atreides and heir to its rule. Harkonnen is ruled by Baron Harkonnen who gives a new definition to the word ""overweight"". Harkonnen may have been inspired by the Medicis of Florence, and maybe House Atreides loosely inspired by the House of Mocenigo in Venice. Or he simply made each House their own character. Of course the baddies are House Harkonnen, bald albinos, where there is very little individuality, almost like clones.

Second, a trade commodity with high demand. Indigenous to Arrakis is the spice Melange, which is only found on Arrakis which makes Dune a prize possession in the galaxy. Melange has both healing and even regenerative capabilities as well euphoric effects making it the most highly-sought-after commodity in the Galaxy.

Third, sophisticated societies. On Arrakis there are several cultural societies, some friendly, others more adversarial. There are the Fremen who are native to Dune and divided up into several different groups, one of which believes in the prophecy of a savior while another looks at the world from a more secular view. (Sound familiar?)

There is also the Bene Gesserit, an interplanetary matriarchal society with mystique powers. They have elements of a Roman Catholic Convent with those of the Knights Templar. They are mostly nonviolent but use their mystique powers to wield power over the other Houses. Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and Paul's mother.

And then a random impediment. What makes mining the spice Melange so challenging is that giant sandworms roam all over Dune. They are about as long as a two tower bridge with a height and width of about six trains. They are attracted by static repeating sounds which makes avoiding them very difficult.

All these elements combined into a messianic and militaristic adventure at the highest level.

"I am not a person that goes to the movies. I much prefer the comfort of my own home and my own amenities. After watching, the admittedly slow but large in scale, first film of this adaptation, my wife and I were convinced that we MUST see the follow-up in theaters. We were not disappointed.

This movie made me feel the way people from the era of Star Wars describe what it was like to see the original trilogy in theaters. I spent the majority of the movie awestruck with my mouth agape.

People will formulate their own opinions about the content of the film versus the book, but simply as an in-theater experience. This film is nearly flawless in every imaginable way. The sounds can be both subtle and booming, the visuals are breathtaking in nearly every single scene, the special effects are absolutely top notch and the acting is stellar AT WORST.

"I'm not sure why I see all these posts calling for dune part 2 to be a masterpiece. Certainly it has the casting and production value to be great but upon watching it is such a let down compared to the first. As a director I love Denis Villeneuve but I feel like he's squandering his directorial might on dune. You can't just have amazing scenery and soundtrack without plot and scriptwriting to back it up which it does not. To me this is another indication that Hollywood has lost its way trending towards visuals over plot. I'm intrigued as to how they plan to salvage the franchise with part 3 but I think film enthusiasts need to be sceptical. How does a movie so lack lustre get such great reviews, review's that were better than the first? Are critics being paid off or are they brainwashed.

"I loved Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2049' but I found his Dune parts 1 and 2 extremely difficult to enjoy, despite the impressive photography. The main issue for me lies in the lack of a relatable protagonist. Timothée Chalamet's acting is great but he is not charismatic in the role of Paul. This affects the way we, the audience, are (un)able to empathise with the protagonist and his narrative arc. The only character in Villeneuve's take on Dune I liked was Jason Momoa's incarnation of Duncan in Part 1.

Like many others, I wanted to like this but I could not. This prompted me to rewatch Lynch's Dune (1984), a masterpiece in disarray, quoting the title of M. Evry's excellent book, a film broken during editing and post-production by Universal and De Laurentiis. In spite of its many flaws, the theatrical cut has so much vision, a unique vibe, and a spectacular soundtrack that makes for a much more enjoyable watch.

"Part 2 eclipses the first movie and builds on it, setting up what will no doubt be an impressive trilogy.

The biggest worry I had about adapting Dune is Paul. Over the course of the story, he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman, and that might be a problem for the audience, since stories usually need a relatable character. Timothée Chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable character.

Villeneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution: beef up the role of Chani so that she becomes that relatable character. I can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy, which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this movie.

This is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of Villeneuve's invention that the first two were, anyway.",part eclips first movi build set doubt impress trilog the biggest worri i adapt dune paul over cours stori chang likabl kid someth cosmic inhuman might problem audienc sinc stori usual need relat charact timoth chalamet manag transit skill believ still leav audienc without relat charact villeneuv seem hit ideal solut beef role chani becom relat charact i alreadi envis role third movi trilog doubt alreadi plan given huge box offic success movi thi big departur book third movi go villeneuv invent first two anyway
"Dune part 1 is basically a build up for this part and oh boy was that build up worth the wait. This is what you expect a sequel to do. Not only follow up the story but surpass it. Which this movie definitely achieved.

Every actor and actress nailed their roles. It's acted to perfection, has breathtaking visuals, the soundtrack is amazing.

It's a prefect recipe for a blockbuster. But apart from that it also has a really good storyline with themes such as consequences of war, prophecies and hope. And what it does to a man. Timothee Chalamet absolutely nailed the role of Paul Atreidies.

I was grinning through the entirety of the last 40 minutes. After so many attempts of mediocrity we finally have a movie that does justice to Frank Herbert's work and space opera genre.",dune part basic build part oh boy build worth wait thi expect sequel not follow stori surpass which movi definit achiev everi actor actress nail role it act perfect breathtak visual soundtrack amaz it prefect recip blockbust but apart also realli good storylin theme consequ war propheci hope and man timothe chalamet absolut nail role paul atreidi i grin entireti last minut after mani attempt mediocr final movi justic frank herbert work space opera genr
"I would say that my expectations going into the movie were somewhat high. The book is highly loved and I enjoyed the first movie greatly. And yet, it blew my mind. One of my first thoughts coming out of the theater was how it compared to empire strikes back. I mean could this have been better? Maybe. It certainly gave me more goosebumps. It was more visually stunning and had a soundtrack that while not as iconic, certainly feels more true to the atmosphere of the movie. It had been a long time since a sci-fi made me forget I was watching a movie. The movie has three strengths: the beginning, the middle, and the end. Although the beginning and end were definitely my favorite. Now I'm just crying thinking about waiting for part three.",i would say expect go movi somewhat high the book highli love i enjoy first movi greatli and yet blew mind one first thought come theater compar empir strike back i mean could better mayb it certainli gave goosebump it visual stun soundtrack icon certainli feel true atmospher movi it long time sinc scifi made forget i watch movi the movi three strength begin middl end although begin end definit favorit now im cri think wait part three
"Dune: Part Two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of Terminator: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part II, and The Empire Strikes Back; a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia; a picture that solidifies Denis Villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form. Even those who weren't so hot on the first film, finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull, seem to have been thoroughly won over.

And although I enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness (imposing brutalist structures towering over nature), the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven, exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in sci-fi history. Although I thought the characters worked fine in the original, in the sequel we're treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know -- when critics said ""I liked Dune: Part One just fine, but I just can't buy Timothée Chalamet as the hero"", readers of the Frank Herbert novel snickered (in Part Two, new fans will see why).

If nothing else, they find that the whole thing feels more complete (recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadn't a clue it was just ""Part One""). Frank Herbert's son, Brian, wrote ""When the new movie is combined with Dune: Part One it is by far the best film interpretation of Dune that has ever been done"".

Other things that are expanded on and/or elevated include the performances of Zendaya (one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation, underused in the prior movie) as Chani, the young Fremen warrior who welcomed Paul Atreides into their camps after the fall of his ""House"", and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother who becomes the ""Reverend Mother"" of the Fremen, who believe she and Paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim Planet Arrakis from oppression -- the Imperial spice-mining colonies that now belong to the vile Harkonnen family. On that note, we also get a better look at the Harkonnen homeworld, whose ""black sun"" seems to erase all color from it, bar the blackest of black and whitest of white.

This moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater. I cannot stress it enough. These sequences -- from the most thunderous battles and Sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats -- are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium, complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very Earth tremble (then falling dead silent at pivotal moments), all sublimely photographed by ""swirly bokeh"" extraordinaire Greig Fraser. (It's not often you see a film and just know you're witnessing the creation of ""iconic"" images.) The action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and, of course, the performances.

The most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha (that's the Sting character in the 1984 movie, in case you needed the reference), lauded by many as the best villain performance since Anton Chigurh and Ledger's Joker. Additional newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Léa Seydoux as Lady Fenring of the ""Bene Gesseret"" priestesses, and Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.

Returning actors include Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar, whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs; Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, who is out for Harkonnen blood; Stellan Skarsgård as the revolting Baron Harkonnen; Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban, who envies the affection the Baron shows toward Feyd; and Charlotte Rampling as the Imperial Reverend Mother, who hatches schemes of her own. Certain characters I've mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time, yet they all make a considerable impact, from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder, most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between Paul, Chani, and the Princess.

At the center is Chalamet as Paul ""Muad'Dib"" Atreides -- a performance that will vindicate his stans and make non-believers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be, but what he was truly going for in Part One. Chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor; yet, we have absolutely no trouble believing that his Paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of Sandworms. As I wrote earlier, those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a garden-variety ""Hero's Journey"" are bound to have an ""oh"" moment or two.

If you're still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works, recall that Dune is (likely) an older series than whatever you're thinking of. All the same, even the familiar images feel new here -- epic in scale in a way that cinema hasn't been able to achieve until now. This movie is a close-to-perfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystal-clear vision for said tech to realize. In part, the movie plays as if Villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and, as if on a dare, went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel, putting the doubters in their place.

Knowing how the books go, I know this franchise is far from done. And despite how long this film was, I never wanted it to end and still crave more, ergo I'm more than stoked to see what Villeneuve does with the rest of Herbert's legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it. The world of Dune is a uniquely well-realized potential future: intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand, and dreadfully convincing on the other, showing that Imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead. (Had this film been made with even less studio interference, the parallels between the Fremens' plight and Palestine may have been even more obvious.)

The story of Dune Messiah still needs to be adapted and I'm confident that, once Villeneuve shows it to us, the same media illiterates who started posting Film Twitter Takes about how Poor Things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital won't be taking Paul's ""White Savior"" and Jessica's cultural appropriation at face value -- or so we may hope. An interesting theory from Walter Chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of Dune -- and Paul Atreides specifically -- is that ""colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny"" that it's straight-up impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy.

"-Interesting visually no doubt, FX aren't overdone and are well incorporated into the story. Score was fine, it's all pretty much the same here as the first one. This one is more entertaining due to the nature of the content in the source material, more action then the borefest of the first one.

-messiah bashing and subversion, twisting the narrative, ""control people tell them messiah is coming"" then the angle the imposters have today, that they are their own messiah collectively, yeah collectively like collectivism, marxism forms whose nominal inventor was one of the tribe big surprise. And marxism includes fascism, just some details as to the state picks which private concerns gets loans Vs. The state owns all concerns, that's the only difference. The other thing being that fascism is closer to tribesterism as the chosen super people material worship of themselves as gods. Hmmm what does that tell you about the theater we got in the last 150 years, heck go back to old nappy he did a great job for them until he tried to found a hereditary dynasty then the brotherhood on all sides scuttled it. Collectively antichrist is more accurate no doubt.

-Oh look the evil bad guys are white and bald, hmmm. The first imagery we get is of burning bodies, hmm whose used that fairytale for so long for money, pity, privleges and more?

-The obvious desert storm garb and Crusades references, old bushy-steinberg and associates had that all planned long before some cgi and controlled demolition megavideodrome show was executed, subversion from within old game. Mr bushy-steinberg Senior AKA ""poppy"" fields and penzoil dope inc kingpin was all in that too but it's an intl mafia cult thing to plan these things for a long time, 1688 comes to mind. 1450-1550 comes to mind, the serpent rising- icarus all over again.

-Obvious jesuit reference but of course totally inverted by these inversion cultists, where's the jADL? Oh wait...

-Spice, drugs, soma, to ""travel through space"" it's A.nother Looong trip man!! Dope inc stuff, rock-drugs, roll-sex they built their city on sand called rock and roll, the tides will turn and it will be swept away carrying them into the abyss, enjoy your time while it lasts.

-annoying racial politics and also gender politics. And to those who aren't clueless you know these are all invert cultists in this movie and all of them, in front of, to the side of, in back of the camera. The financiers of all this propaganda are the same in this cult of the bapho-inana. We go from a chani that makes sense to a mixing version of the kalergi marxist plan. You on top you use the rabble as much as possible to further your own interests, have your cryptos all over in them to be the leaders. Kabbalistic dialectics by the infrahumans.

-Frank Herbery,FH, 67, as below so above, and the books are a hermetic-kabbalistic codex really, this movie is no different. It's a cult thing. There was never any doubt a remake of this cult codex of drugs, GOT stuff and the propaganda was going to be fully financed. We even have Treasury Secretaries financing movies in the past, you actually pay for these dumpster fires whether you want to or not. Same in the other major media markets worldwide.

-Fugly bapho actors. Chalamet the girlytranneeman is just bizarre looking due to the hormones and such of this cult but the jaw implants, HUGE chinplant, sly-ina droopy eyes and all the other procedures just give this a cartoony fake look, and that's saying a lot when you stand out like that in the zoo animal preserve that T-hukerwood is. We have Mr Poo here doing his thing, all hardened up as they all do in this part of the cult, lose a ton of weight all over, hit them dietpills and certainly harder things oof.

"Dune: Part Two is intelligent blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. An epic tragedy told on the biggest canvas imaginable with every department operating in unison and at the top of their game. The first Dune may have focused on the set-up but that doesn't mean this one is rushing straight into the action, maintaining that immersive slow burning nature.

Timothée Chalamet got a nice journey in the original, however this one is so much bigger. He plays the internal conflict so well as he tries his best to avoid his destiny and by the end he feels like a different person entirely in a way that doesn't come out of nowhere. In those earlier moments he also displays palpable chemistry with Zendaya as they begin to truly connect.

As well as having that strong chemistry with Chalamet, Zendaya is given so much more to do here (as promised), essentially becoming co-lead. As the film descends further in its climactic moments, she remains the only one who's able to see through the manipulation that's happening with a fair few moments where her looks of frustration say everything.

There are so many huge names in this cast that don't get much in an impactful way. All of them are fully committed to their smaller parts with Austin Butler being a major highlight. The film describes him as psychotic and honestly that's putting it mildly. His deliberate impersonation of the Baron really works to make him even more unsettling.

It's clear from its first major action sequence, bathed in a beautiful orange hue, that director Denis Villeneuve is a master of the craft at this point. Even compared to Part One, the scale of this chapter is immense with returning cinematographer Greig Fraser bringing his specific set of skills to make this an undeniable cinematic event.

Considering how good his previous score was, Hans Zimmer could've easily coasted for this one by just reusing all of those themes but it's obvious that he wouldn't do that because he clearly loves playing in this sandbox. Almost every transcendent piece from last time is still present and there's new ones that are equally memorable.",dune part two intellig blockbust filmmak finest an epic tragedi told biggest canva imagin everi depart oper unison top game the first dune may focus setup doesnt mean one rush straight action maintain immers slow burn natur timoth chalamet got nice journey origin howev one much bigger he play intern conflict well tri best avoid destini end feel like differ person entir way doesnt come nowher in earlier moment also display palpabl chemistri zendaya begin truli connect a well strong chemistri chalamet zendaya given much promis essenti becom colead a film descend climact moment remain one who abl see manipul that happen fair moment look frustrat say everyth there mani huge name cast dont get much impact way all fulli commit smaller part austin butler major highlight the film describ psychot honestli that put mildli hi deliber imperson baron realli work make even unsettl it clear first major action sequenc bath beauti orang hue director deni villeneuv master craft point even compar part one scale chapter immens return cinematograph greig fraser bring specif set skill make undeni cinemat event consid good previou score han zimmer couldv easili coast one reus theme obviou wouldnt clearli love play sandbox almost everi transcend piec last time still present there new one equal memor
"I watched this film on the basis that I'd watched the first one and felt I needed to complete the story...but I wished I hadn't. To say it was glacial would still imply movement, however slow. This was worse than that. It was completely static. There was too much pseudo mystical talk in a made up language that needed subtitles. There were too many blank expressions on the faces of the actors, and I use the term loosely. None of them actually acted, they all just went through the motions. In short, this film is boring. I know a great many people think the Dune saga is sci fi at its very best but if you've read the book and not been a particular fan of Frank Herbert, you would realise the man was a bit of a windbag and that a decent editor could have brought the length of the story down by at least a third and no one would have been any the wiser. If someone had done that, Dune might have been a good tale. As it is, it's ponderous and pretentious.",i watch film basi id watch first one felt i need complet storybut i wish i hadnt to say glacial would still impli movement howev slow thi wors it complet static there much pseudo mystic talk made languag need subtitl there mani blank express face actor i use term loo none actual act went motion in short film bore i know great mani peopl think dune saga sci fi best youv read book particular fan frank herbert would realis man bit windbag decent editor could brought length stori least third one would wiser if someon done dune might good tale a ponder pretenti
"I'll try keep this simple so...this is the exact type of movie you go to see on the big screen, just literal jaw drop-age. The scale of this feels so massive and makes you feel so tiny in so many scenes and it blew me away. The effects were so damn brilliant with some of the most stunning visuals you will ever be able to see from a movie. The acting by the entire cast was completely from the top shelf with a special shout-out to Austin Butler, his Feyd-Rautha was perfect and the score oooft, it had me tapping my foot at times. I also swear at some points I could smell the sand that's how immersed I was in this movie.

After watching a couple more lower budget type Sci-fi movies lately that are slightly different Sci-fi genre like Synchronic and Freaks (which I enjoyed both a lot) to then go and watch Dune part 2 and just think yeahhhhh this is a whole other level. I think I saw the budget for the new Gladiator was 310 million and Dune part 2 was 190 million. For this to look just as unbelievably amazing as it did with that budget it makes me think what the hell will they do with Gladiator money?

I've read the book and loved it, I've seen part 1 and 2 and loved them. Some scenes in part 2 in the movie were so much better than imagined from the book. Any Sci-fi lover that doesn't like this movie I'll be shocked. It's an absolute epic of the genre that I think will be hard to top anytime soon if at all. Everyone needs to see this on the big screen and lose yourself on the planet Dune.

Denis Villeneuve has nailed this and might be my favourite creator in the industry at the moment with Nolan. Their tone and styles just extract the unreal I crave from cinema at the moment, hopefully a lot more to come.",ill tri keep simpl sothi exact type movi go see big screen liter jaw dropag the scale feel massiv make feel tini mani scene blew away the effect damn brilliant stun visual ever abl see movi the act entir cast complet top shelf special shoutout austin butler feydrautha perfect score oooft tap foot time i also swear point i could smell sand that immers i movi after watch coupl lower budget type scifi movi late slightli differ scifi genr like synchron freak i enjoy lot go watch dune part think yeahhhhh whole level i think i saw budget new gladiat million dune part million for look unbeliev amaz budget make think hell gladiat money ive read book love ive seen part love some scene part movi much better imagin book ani scifi lover doesnt like movi ill shock it absolut epic genr i think hard top anytim soon everyon need see big screen lose planet dune deni villeneuv nail might favourit creator industri moment nolan their tone style extract unreal i crave cinema moment hope lot come
"Everything about this movie is so good that it practically made me numb. I still can't even process it. I'm a huge fan of the novels, and in a few ways this movie manages to improve on the source material by giving us a very intimate rendition of this awesome story.

It totally kicks ass on all fronts. Writing, visuals, sound design/music, and acting at its absolute highest levels on the grandest scale. Truly epic. One of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever made. No easy task either given the film's source material, but executed tastefully and dare I say, flawlessly utilizing minor alterations to create the best film it can be. Believe the hype. If you don't like this movie, then well, I guess epic sci-fi stories and deserts simply aren't your thing. Fair enough, but for most of us, it really doesn't get any better than this.

The script is excellent. This was a very hard novel to adapt, and the writers have truly done a fantastic job with it. Changes have been made from the source material, details added, but essentially it captures the best themes of the book. Overall, each change, cut, or addition makes for a better movie, still remaining faithful to the films source material. I will admit however, that the Dune nerd in me would have liked to see that talking baby... but the way they did it was effective and probably better for the silver screen. Frank Herbert purist might get pretty bummed over this, but not I. The change works well, and I trust Denis Villeneuve with what he wanted to do in his telling.

I want to point out that I was kind of surprised how terrific the acting in this film was considering the amount of vanity and celebrity the cast seems to bask in. This isn't just a cast of what Marilyn Manson would call ""the beautiful people"" but actually a talented one. Timothy Chalamet really brings it in the films second half. He was born to play Paul Atreides, and I would have never of known he was capable of pulling it off so well with what I have previously seen him in. I loved Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, but it was actually Javier Bardem as Stilgar that I enjoyed the most. His character is beautifully written in this screenplay, providing smart laugh out loud comic relief but also delivering serious dramatic scenes with awesome dialogue. His delivery of ""I don't care if you do not believe, I believe..."" which was perfectly placed in the trailer is even better in the film. The man is a very good actor, obviously given his track record, and it was simply awesome seeing him deliver such well written dialogue.

The visual fx... I don't even know how to convey how great they look. They, simply put, are stunning. What a treat to see it in IMAX. This movie truly was made for IMAX. It looks incredible.

Which brings me to cinematography. Also stunning. Absolute perfection. The lighting and color pallets... my God, it's just stunning.

Sound design and score are every bit as awesome as they were in the first film. Perfection. Hans Zimmer is really in the prime of his career, giving us stunningly original and memorable works of music.

As far as memorable scenes and sequences go, every single one hits pretty hard and is expertly crafted. The climatic final knife fight was the best I had scene since the climatic sword fight in Rob Roy. But I can't write this gushing review without mentioning the sand-worm riding scene where Paul first mounts one of these iconic beast. WOW. This goes down as one of my favorite scenes ever in a film. I practically edged myself off my seat, even knowing what the outcome would be having read the book. It was just... wow, so cool.

Upon the movie ending, my wife and I just wanted to stay in the theater and watch it over again. I can't wait to see this film again, and again, and again. I really think it is a modern classic. This isn't something I say lightly. The hype was real for me. I hope you all feel the same as I did, because both Dune and Dune: Part 2 are some of the greatest times I've had at the movies in the past twenty years. This is what large budget major studio films should be. This is art on its grandest scale, not just a cheap attempt to cash in on a beloved franchise. It's so refreshing and nice to see that Hollywood still has a few quality films to make. In my personal opinion, Timothy Chalamet and Zendaya earned every right to wear those ludicrous outfits on the red carpet. They could have worn hot dog suits for all I care, because not only did they do a fantastic job, but the entire cast and crew. This film helped create something people such as myself will be enjoying for a very, very long time.",everyth movi good practic made numb i still cant even process im huge fan novel way movi manag improv sourc materi give u intim rendit awesom stori it total kick as front write visual sound designmus act absolut highest level grandest scale truli epic one best adapt novel screen ever made no easi task either given film sourc materi execut tast dare i say flawlessli util minor alter creat best film believ hype if dont like movi well i guess epic scifi stori desert simpli arent thing fair enough u realli doesnt get better the script excel thi hard novel adapt writer truli done fantast job chang made sourc materi detail ad essenti captur best theme book overal chang cut addit make better movi still remain faith film sourc materi i admit howev dune nerd would like see talk babi way effect probabl better silver screen frank herbert purist might get pretti bum i the chang work well i trust deni villeneuv want tell i want point i kind surpris terrif act film consid amount vaniti celebr cast seem bask thi isnt cast marilyn manson would call beauti peopl actual talent one timothi chalamet realli bring film second half he born play paul atreid i would never known capabl pull well i previous seen i love austin butler feydrautha actual javier bardem stilgar i enjoy hi charact beauti written screenplay provid smart laugh loud comic relief also deliv seriou dramat scene awesom dialogu hi deliveri i dont care believ i believ perfectli place trailer even better film the man good actor obvious given track record simpli awesom see deliv well written dialogu the visual fx i dont even know convey great look they simpli put stun what treat see imax thi movi truli made imax it look incred which bring cinematographi also stun absolut perfect the light color pallet god stun sound design score everi bit awesom first film perfect han zimmer realli prime career give u stunningli origin memor work music a far memor scene sequenc go everi singl one hit pretti hard expertli craft the climat final knife fight best i scene sinc climat sword fight rob roy but i cant write gush review without mention sandworm ride scene paul first mount one icon beast wow thi goe one favorit scene ever film i practic edg seat even know outcom would read book it wow cool upon movi end wife i want stay theater watch i cant wait see film i realli think modern classic thi isnt someth i say lightli the hype real i hope feel i dune dune part greatest time ive movi past twenti year thi larg budget major studio film thi art grandest scale cheap attempt cash belov franchis it refresh nice see hollywood still qualiti film make in person opinion timothi chalamet zendaya earn everi right wear ludicr outfit red carpet they could worn hot dog suit i care fantast job entir cast crew thi film help creat someth peopl enjoy long time
"Yes, I know, is it a""10""? Yes.

I've gone back and bumped my rating for past 1 because the story has been well connected and expanded in all the best ways.

While it isn't on the same level as The God Father, as a science fiction epic it is a home run. Chalumet has both grown into the role, and himself, perfectly embodying the initially reluctant, then aggressively focused, savior. There are prices to paid though. Physical, emotional and psychological pain and damage. And sacrifice.

All of which is effectively felt because of Zendaya's performance. Her cautiously loving but fierce warrior is much more present in this film, and it is improved by it. There are two scenes in particular where she has almost no dialogue, but powerfully commands attention through her subtle, and some not so subtle, expressions.

Butler as sociopathic nut job Raubatha and Josh Brolin as MuadDib's adviser lieutenant are excellent. Dave Bautista delivers a strange performance, looking confused and afraid until he randomly lashes out and kills someone.

Clearly positioned for a Part 3, the movie ends with a satisfactory conclusion, but one filled with portent and ominous promise.

"It's a masterpiece, you need to watch it carefully, every scene, detailing and on screen depiction of every scene is great, outstanding special effects, comparable to that of Star Wars. There are one or two Oscars waiting for it. Better than Dune one. Keeps same expectations as Dark Knight, RRR and Mandalorian(Series). It is going to meet it. Watch it in IMAX if possible also in atmos sound system. In Hindi, I can say, ""Bawaal movie"". Acting is Okayish but Bgm, special effects and story is awesome.

"This is arguably the best sci-fi movie of all time. Can't think of a span with more than 2 minutes of downtime. From start to finish you are completely immersed in a new world with mesmerizing imagery, and unbelievable score, and amazing dialogue. Dune 2 should stay in IMAX for as long as possible. It is a truly amazing experience and worth every penny to see in theaters.

"For starters I loved the first film and I'm an enormous fan of the director, all his movies are nothing short of perfect. I prefer the first film here but this second part is a truly unique experience. I'm a fan of the slow burn of the first one, this one feels very much like a large scale action movie. Some lesser directors would've made this film instead of a two parter. By that I mean I could see another director, like Lynch(83), condensing the first film into narration and dialogue and just going for the action of this film. There's very little of Villeneuve's trippy long shots. Very little of his patience and silence. This film is still spectacular and visually stunning. I really loved this movie. It doesn't feel like nearly 3 hours, it moves, its pacing is great.",for starter i love first film im enorm fan director movi noth short perfect i prefer first film second part truli uniqu experi im fan slow burn first one one feel much like larg scale action movi some lesser director wouldv made film instead two parter by i mean i could see anoth director like lynch condens first film narrat dialogu go action film there littl villeneuv trippi long shot veri littl patienc silenc thi film still spectacular visual stun i realli love movi it doesnt feel like nearli hour move pace great
"A beautifully directed film that suffers from a lot of boring and mumbled dialogue. Part One was a great film, almost perfect. It did all the heavy lifting of setting the scene and world building that should have allowed Part Two to just get on with things. However we spend the first hour of this film explaining to the audience what is going on, and even then it's baffling to most who haven't read the books.

The acting is great throughout and the cinematography is some of the best you'll ever see, as you would expect from Denis but it just doesn't make up for the pacing and dialogue which fall short in this one.",a beauti direct film suffer lot bore mumbl dialogu part one great film almost perfect it heavi lift set scene world build allow part two get thing howev spend first hour film explain audienc go even baffl havent read book the act great throughout cinematographi best youll ever see would expect deni doesnt make pace dialogu fall short one

"The film is epic, the acting is great and the special effects amazing. Full credit to the cast and production teams. Not so much the editing though. The film is too long by far although this seems to be the new norm. At times I was bored and some scenes felt totally out of place or overdone. I suspect the raft of 10/10 scores are a result of poor competition ( another Kong film?) or people just looking to hang their hat on something popular. Dune stands out among the films of the last few years that are trying similar things but as an all time great it won't even be a footnote.

The soundtrack is a standout though, up there with Maverick as a cinema experience.",the film epic act great special effect amaz full credit cast product team not much edit though the film long far although seem new norm at time i bore scene felt total place overdon i suspect raft score result poor competit anoth kong film peopl look hang hat someth popular dune stand among film last year tri similar thing time great wont even footnot the soundtrack standout though maverick cinema experi
"Sorry but no: This is a farce and a scam! Where as in Dune part 1 there was a story, a plotline visible, logic, and a clear path, in this part, there is absolutely not. It has been massively cut and shortened - or, if this is the script, it's lazier than a old fat cat.

Roles are comicaly unphased, no connection of rabaul or the arch-villain from the actor to its role. There is nothing that connects the two parts.

Yes, the image and coloring, effects and such are superb, but the rest is a waste of my time, a waste of everybodies time, a waste of ressources and a waste of talent.

"""Dune 2"" is a masterclass in cinematography, seamlessly blending breathtaking visuals with a narrative that grips the audience from start to finish. The cinematography expertly captures the vastness and intricacies of the Dune universe, from the sweeping desert landscapes to the intricate details of the characters and their surroundings.

The storyline is rich and immersive, staying true to Frank Herbert's vision while adding new layers of depth and complexity. Each character is expertly developed, and the interplay between them drives the narrative forward with a sense of urgency and intrigue.

What truly sets ""Dune 2"" apart is its creativity in bringing Herbert's universe to life. From the intricate costume design to the stunning special effects, every aspect of the film feels meticulously crafted to transport viewers to the world of Arrakis and beyond. The attention to detail is evident in every frame, making ""Dune 2"" a visual feast for the eyes.

"After seeing Interstellar in IMAX opening night, i never thought i'd have a theater experience like that again. Dune: Part Two gave me that experience again.

The performances, the effects, the cinematography, the story, the atmosphere, i don't think it can get much better than this. A truly epic film that sits with The Dark Knight and The Empire Strikes back as sequels.

Dune: Messiah is now my most anticipated film i've had in my lifetime and i know somehow my expectations will be exceeded.

"Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is accepted by part of the Fremen and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes he is the promised one Lisan al Gaib from the prophecy of the people from North. Paul learns the costumes of the Fremen and falls in love with Chani (Zendaya). However, Stilgar and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) want Paul to go to the South to join forces and fight the House Harkonnen and the Emperor, but Paul is afraid of the outcome, since he had a vision of many casualties in the showdown of the Holy War.

""Dune: Part Two"" keeps the good level of the Part One, with an engaging adventure. The decision of Paul to stay with the Emperor's daughter instead of Chani is the most confusing part of the movie. The acting is great, and the CGI and special effects are superb. Looking forward to seeing the Part Three. My vote is eight.

"I don't share the concerns of those complaining about the intricacies of the plot. I haven't read the book, but watched David Lynch's version back in the 80s and understood this just fine. Mind you, I have read Jodorowsky's Dune-influenced Incal, so this was nothing to that level of bizarre and fantastical. My concern was the ridiculous length. It seemed like the countless Netflix movies, where they think that playing two piano chords in a long drawn out way and showing characters blankly pondering emotions, makes it a Scandinavian masterpiece.

Dune Part Two just took too long to do very little. Considering the book is considered unfilmable, I expected there to be too many concepts and plot lines crammed in. But instead watched three hours of drawn out, ponderous scenes, attempting to be a hallucinogenic trip but not having the conviction to commit to it.

It was undeniably magnificently shot, scored and choreographed. The sound design was incredible. I enjoyed looking and listening to it, especially the unique action scenes. But dialogue was often very trite and too on the nose. The vehicles were still good, but lacked the visual impact of Part One. And characters were given disappointingly anti-climactic payoffs.

This was a top end 12 as well. Very graphic and uncomfortable in many places. Beware taking sensitive kids to see this.

I enjoyed Part One (I gave that 7 stars), but was more wowed by the spectacle than the acting or plot. I love Denis Villenuve's work, but Lynch was a closer match to the source material. This instalment lacked the impetus of the first, and therefore flapped pretentiously about as a placeholder between part one and three. It lacks the wonderful weirdness of Frank Herbert's world-especially in the very poorly cast emperor (love the actor, but out place here), Jodorowsky had cast Salvador Dalí, and somehow that tells you all you need to know.

I'm not afraid of a long film, or an arthouse film. I love science fiction, from The Forbidden Planet and Star Wars, to 2001 and Arrival; this perhaps simply suffers from the praise heaped on the original, and ended up working too hard to be even more spectacular.",i dont share concern complain intricaci plot i havent read book watch david lynch version back understood fine mind i read jodorowski duneinfluenc incal noth level bizarr fantast my concern ridicul length it seem like countless netflix movi think play two piano chord long drawn way show charact blankli ponder emot make scandinavian masterpiec dune part two took long littl consid book consid unfilm i expect mani concept plot line cram but instead watch three hour drawn ponder scene attempt hallucinogen trip convict commit it undeni magnific shot score choreograph the sound design incred i enjoy look listen especi uniqu action scene but dialogu often trite nose the vehicl still good lack visual impact part one and charact given disappointingli anticlimact payoff thi top end well veri graphic uncomfort mani place bewar take sensit kid see i enjoy part one i gave star wow spectacl act plot i love deni villenuv work lynch closer match sourc materi thi instal lack impetu first therefor flap pretenti placehold part one three it lack wonder weird frank herbert worldespeci poorli cast emperor love actor place jodorowski cast salvador dal somehow tell need know im afraid long film arthous film i love scienc fiction the forbidden planet star war arriv perhap simpli suffer prais heap origin end work hard even spectacular

The only thing that is bothering me is the thirst so bad for the next part.

The excellence of this movie is not only the cast or the story it is the very making of it. I loved every dialogue that was uttered. Its just a masterpiece.

"OK, this was very well made, acted and filmed and I enjoyed it even though, like many other viewers, I knew the story having seen other versions that were made. The acting was good, the effects were excellent and the design of the buildings, flying machines, etc were really imaginative....but why so many dark interior scenes? Didn't they invent a light bulb in that future world?? So many scenes where I was squinting to see who was who and what they were doing. Why spend millions making an excellent movie and then hide everything in darkness and shadow???? Maybe it sounds petty, but it spoiled the movie for me. I guess the director didn't want to make a shiny cute Star Wars kind of future world., and I get that, but I really felt disappointed that so much was hidden from view just to create a mood or atmosphere.",ok well made act film i enjoy even though like mani viewer i knew stori seen version made the act good effect excel design build fli machin etc realli imaginativebut mani dark interior scene didnt invent light bulb futur world so mani scene i squint see whi spend million make excel movi hide everyth dark shadow mayb sound petti spoil movi i guess director didnt want make shini cute star war kind futur world i get i realli felt disappoint much hidden view creat mood atmospher
"I just don't understand the high scoring for this movie? Long drawn out scenes with constant accompanying noise (it's not back ground music, it's continuous noise similar to a fog horn). The time of this movie could be halved if they removed most of the artistic license.

Overall though, it's boring, really really dull.

I'd love to leave it at that, but there is a requirement for minimum word count. So to make the review more interesting I'll tell you about the weather in Inverness today, it's a strong to gale force westerly with intermittent showers of rain and hail.

"Dune Part Two is a masterpiece, which succeeds in combining all the key parts of creating a true epic:
Strange and intriguing characters, well acted, who develop with the story
Incredible world building - writing, language, costume design, cinematography all working together to create the feeling of being in a very different, but very coherent reality.


Massive spine tingling moments - action sequences and political set pieces that make you feel emotionally invested in the narrative.


A couple of things worth calling out: there are changes to characters and narrative from the book, but they are all relentlessly in service of ensuring that the themes from the book stand more clearly. The narrative is all about the increasing complexity and darkness of the choices facing the lead characters, and like both the book and other Villeneuve films it has no qualms about not answering all the questions it raises.

The second is the pacing - I'm not sure there's a two minute sequence in there I would have cared to miss.

"Part one of Dune was the first part of the famous book of Frank Herbert. Denis Villeneuve captured perfectly the story of Paul Atreides. The first movie comes to a satisfying conclusion but thankfully we get the second half that has more spectacle than the first movie.

I enjoyed both movies as one movie. By now I am so tired of the CGI specticals of Disney that are pushed in their Marvel and Star Wars films because they lack a good story. Dune isn't that, it's a smart movie with a story that has everything from romance to action, intrigues to political and religues plays that put Game of Thrones to shame.

"To take a book as complex and expansive as Dune, and turning it into a trilogy of science fiction cinematic masterpieces, will define the legacy of Dennis Villeneuve. Paul Atreides's quest for revenge erupts into a magnum opus circling around religious fanaticism and their messianic figures and intergalactic politics, culminating in some of the greatest cinematic sequences that you will ever witness. The Cinematography and Sound Design is so insanely good that I fail to remember if any film I have seen in my lifetime can rival this. The VFX is flawless in its execution, and Hans Zimmer's brilliance is once again on full display. So much of the story has been fit into this but tender character moments exist throughout the film. Thundering performances from Rebecca Ferguson, Timothee Chalamet and Javier Bardem. A shame that I was not able to see this on Imax, because Cinema doesn't get visually this spectacular often.

"I am So disappointed. Maybe the hype got to me. I loved part 1.

This is a good film, but I found it lacking. Something was missing. And it is difficult to put a finger on what that is.

The editing was jarring and disruptive for some reason: Scenes did not flow into another. I felt as the viewer as though I was kept at a distance. But that was probably the point. The timing was off and the film kept jumping too quickly from scene to scene. I am a fan of the book. And had if it had not been for that; I may have given up on the film half way through.

The costumes were good; but did not make such an impression on me as part 1 did.

Overall: a good film; but it did not live up to expectations.",i so disappoint mayb hype got i love part thi good film i found lack someth miss and difficult put finger the edit jar disrupt reason scene flow anoth i felt viewer though i kept distanc but probabl point the time film kept jump quickli scene scene i fan book and i may given film half way the costum good make impress part overal good film live expect
"It is such a relief to finally see a movie on the scale of the Dark Knight or other greats.

The acting, direction, sound design, score and visuals are top class and all come together to complete a modern epic.

Sure some of the book purests will disdain the film for verging of the some of the original narrative and others who thought Dune 1 was boring will probably think the same for this.

This movie significantly expands the first movie, while having some of the most intense action scenes I have seen. Plus the political and religious undertones advance the storyline so much more than anything Star Wars could have envisioned..guess it's only fair since Dune influenced Star Wars. And if you are a fan of Game of Thrones this will be right up your alley!

"Wow. Just absolutely wow. This is without a doubt the greatest film so far this decade and might just be the greatest second part of a book to film adaptation since The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It might even be better.

Everything about this movie was achieved perfectly. The quality of the cinematography was cosmic and Grieg Fraser needs to be recognised as the powerhouse of talent he is, especially when he works with Villeneuve because the grandiose of the photography of the wide shots in this film are the most vast and mind blowing I have ever seen in a movie IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!

The musical score from Hans Zimmer was also incredible. It is very different from the first film. There is a lot less chanting and body shaking drums and a lot more focus on more somber sounding woodwind instruments like the Oboe. The main theme/motif of this film is this Oboe melody that is repeated about 4 times in the film and once again for the credits. It has been playing in my head for the past week and I fear that it may never leave. The music was hauntingly beautiful.

The world building is improved to perfection in this movie and the lore is even deeper. There is more going on in the story in Part 2 and is much more deeply rooted in religious themes, symbolism and prophecy much more than science-fiction. That is my only one real gripe with the movie, it's under the Sci-Fi genre but it doesn't really fit it that well since it feels far more like a religious fable, though that's not really an official genre, isn't it.

Without giving much else away, I just want to tell you to go see it in any theatre that you can. Don't wait too late! Do it now!

"Fantastic immersive cinematic experience. Definitely see it on the biggest loudest screen you can find. Villeneuve's direction is the key here, as he masterfully navigates an admittedly obtuse storyline with the sort of operatic flair that pulls an audience in and captures said audience, transporting the viewers to a spellbinding, thrilling crescendo. The mythic elements of Frank Herbert's story requires not only spectacle but gravitas, which Villeneuve understands and implements with solid efficacy, like a painter working with deep, difficult, lustrous oils. And ""Dune"" is that- bold, lustrous, luminous, expressive, massive. We forget sometimes that film is a form of expression, and thus an artform, not just idle entertainment. Villeneuve happily and enthusiastically reminds us with this terrific rendition of Herbert's science fiction classic.",fantast immers cinemat experi definit see biggest loudest screen find villeneuv direct key master navig admittedli obtus storylin sort operat flair pull audienc captur said audienc transport viewer spellbind thrill crescendo the mythic element frank herbert stori requir spectacl gravita villeneuv understand implement solid efficaci like painter work deep difficult lustrou oil and dune bold lustrou lumin express massiv we forget sometim film form express thu artform idl entertain villeneuv happili enthusiast remind u terrif rendit herbert scienc fiction classic

Some movies pave way for a new standard. This one with the story, the insane visual effects, and the activating music behind it all.

This movie and part 1 both did something even Oppenheimer and similar could not. They made you stare at the explosions in satisfaction and full of nerves.

This is a trilogy of means we have yet to see. Its the beauty of Interstellar and Inception, but in the form of a trilogy, with even greater use of the cinema as a artform.

A movie where 3+ characters are worthy of actor of the decade. Where we see characters from all sides of emotions, some guided by belief, some by fear, some by heart, and some by hatred.

This is on good way of becoming the best trilogy to exist.

Where part 1 came short because of its nature as a pilot movie, this has gone beyond. Only Dune: Messiah will seal the fate of this trilogy.",in decad great despair blockbust stori shine some movi pave way new standard thi one stori insan visual effect activ music behind thi movi part someth even oppenheim similar could they made stare explos satisfact full nerv thi trilog mean yet see it beauti interstellar incept form trilog even greater use cinema artform a movi charact worthi actor decad where see charact side emot guid belief fear heart hatr thi good way becom best trilog exist where part came short natur pilot movi gone beyond onli dune messiah seal fate trilog
"There were great elements here, but they really needed someone in charge to tie it up into a nice hour and a half long package. It felt like way too much extra footage left in scattered all throughout the middle and mid-end, and I'm frustrated thinking about how much of a punch this movie could have packed if it were properly edited to do so. Still, great cinematography and sound design, and some intense moments in the first hour and last half hour or so. It would be hard to bring myself to go through a rewatch for these moments, given that I'd have to sit through all the rest, so this will probably wind up being a movie I forget about.",there great element realli need someon charg tie nice hour half long packag it felt like way much extra footag left scatter throughout middl midend im frustrat think much punch movi could pack properli edit still great cinematographi sound design intens moment first hour last half hour it would hard bring go rewatch moment given id sit rest probabl wind movi i forget
"This wasnt just a movie, it was a experience, a journey, a movie with soul! This movie expands upon part one in such a good way and together bring justice to Frank Herberts book and message.

My reaction to just having seen this is that I need to watch it again NOW! The movie got great visuals, bombastic sound effects, beautiful music and each actor played their part perfectly.

This was just a perfect sequel and I cant stop think about it!

It is unlike anything i have ever seen before (even dune part 1 which was excellent) this movie is a true cinematic experience, a beautiful journey towards something grand, epic, emotional, creepy and dramatic.

It brings up alot of questions and got alot nuances and depth to the story and overall theme. With new characters, location and a more in depth look at the fremen culture the world feels much more alive.

This is a once in a decade movie made with soul in my opinion.",thi wasnt movi experi journey movi soul thi movi expand upon part one good way togeth bring justic frank herbert book messag my reaction seen i need watch now the movi got great visual bombast sound effect beauti music actor play part perfectli thi perfect sequel i cant stop think it unlik anyth ever seen even dune part excel movi true cinemat experi beauti journey toward someth grand epic emot creepi dramat it bring alot question got alot nuanc depth stori overal theme with new charact locat depth look fremen cultur world feel much aliv thi decad movi made soul opinion
"I read Dune shortly after it was published and have been a fan ever since, having read most of the canon.

The first attempt at filming the book in 1984 was flawed, but I felt it was a valiant attempt.

Dune Part 1 was not too bad and promised to be a reasonable version. It was missing some plot elements whose absence I couldn't really fathom (especially as there was a further three hours-worth to come) but I was willing to give them a pass on that pending the second part.

Saw Part 2 yesterday, truly disappointing. Important elements missed out/distorted needlessly, flaws in the details/unlikely scenarios, and clear inaccuracies in the way some things were portrayed. There was plenty of the time that was devoted to big explosions etc that could have been better used in depicting the worthwhile missing aspects of the book.

Definitely not recommended. To be honest I am not sure why I've given it two stars - maybe I just don't have it in me to downgrade something with Frank Herbert's name on it to the lowest possible grade.",i read dune shortli publish fan ever sinc read canon the first attempt film book flaw i felt valiant attempt dune part bad promis reason version it miss plot element whose absenc i couldnt realli fathom especi three hoursworth come i will give pas pend second part saw part yesterday truli disappoint import element miss outdistort needlessli flaw detailsunlik scenario clear inaccuraci way thing portray there plenti time devot big explos etc could better use depict worthwhil miss aspect book definit recommend to honest i sure ive given two star mayb i dont downgrad someth frank herbert name lowest possibl grade
"As someone who typically dislikes fantasy and sci-fi, I surprisingly found myself thoroughly enjoying the first Dune movie. The sheer scale of the film, its world-building, mythology, geo-political intricacies, and overall meticulous approach left a lasting impression on me. Naturally, my anticipation for ""Dune: Part Two"" was high, and now that it's here, the question looms: ""Does it hold up well against the first?""

Well, as you might have guessed from my title, my answer is a resounding 'yes'. It delivers everything one could have hoped for from a Dune sequel, leaving no room for disappointment. The elements that made the first movie so special are present here in just the right amounts-never overdone nor toned down. With visually spectacular scenes, amazing cinematography, elaborately majestic set pieces, intricate costume designs, an epic soundtrack, and captivating action choreography, the film is a must-watch in cinemas.

It's one of those rare movies that truly justifies a trip to the cinemas, and as far as Dune is concerned, it may be the last installment for a while, given that Part 3 is not expected anytime soon. If you've seen the first part, make sure not to miss the second in theaters. And if you haven't seen the first part yet, watch it now and ensure you catch the second installment in theaters.",a someon typic dislik fantasi scifi i surprisingli found thoroughli enjoy first dune movi the sheer scale film worldbuild mytholog geopolit intricaci overal meticul approach left last impress natur anticip dune part two high question loom doe hold well first well might guess titl answer resound ye it deliv everyth one could hope dune sequel leav room disappoint the element made first movi special present right amountsnev overdon tone with visual spectacular scene amaz cinematographi elabor majest set piec intric costum design epic soundtrack captiv action choreographi film mustwatch cinema it one rare movi truli justifi trip cinema far dune concern may last instal given part expect anytim soon if youv seen first part make sure miss second theater and havent seen first part yet watch ensur catch second instal theater

"I can't believe my eyes what just I experienced in theatre, this movie is one of the best cinematic experience I've ever had.. From opening scene to end credit every second is worth it.. Epic score by Hans Zimmer elevates the experience, filled with beautiful shots and cinematography to a great scrrenplay and some top notch acting by every cast member Dune 2 will be remembered as one of the best films of this generation even after 50 years later that's my guarantee.. Denis Villeneuve is one of the best director of this generation who gave us masterpiece like Blade Runner 2049 and currently working on 3rd part of this trilogy which I can't wait to see.. Action scenes were great featuring big ships, blasters laser guns and every other kind of weapons, sound effects were amazing but most importantly screenplay was well paced and story featuring blend of sci fi and fantasy elements is absolute best of the best even though it is an adaptation of 1965 novel of same name it is one of the best adaptations ever.. I loved both movies and can't wait to see what happens in future because I enjoy films about The Chosen One Prophecy like Star Wars, The Matrix and now this.. I won't give any spoiler here and will not talk about anything shown in the movie since you need to see this movie for yourself to feel the magic.. Don't miss it at any cost..

"Feels like this was filmed back to back with the first Dune, cause it looks like the actors never really left there roles, all get back into it quite easily.

Timothee Chalamet really more depth to Paul Atreides in the second film, exploring his doubts and his sense of commitment to those who believe in him. But I also liked Austin Butler has Feyd, he really brings the insanity of the character to life, such a scene stealer every time he's on camera. But Zendaya is also great has Chani, expolring more into her character then ever. Action scenes are good when they happen, and effects are great even when it comes to the sand worm.",feel like film back back first dune caus look like actor never realli left role get back quit easili timothe chalamet realli depth paul atreid second film explor doubt sen commit believ but i also like austin butler feyd realli bring insan charact life scene stealer everi time he camera but zendaya also great chani expolr charact ever action scene good happen effect great even come sand worm
"This sprawling, potent sequel is a high water mark in science fiction filmmaking. Paul Atreides (Chalamet) has joined forces with the Fremen whose advance continues over disintegrating armies. Paul is viewed by some Fremen as a foreigner but by others as a savior. He himself regards their faith as mere folklore even as his mother Lady Jessica (Ferguson) ascends to the position of Reverend Mother. But eventually Paul watches his own moral code and ethics erode as he rises to the position of ruler. This part of the film accentuates the weakening of principles as power accumulates.

The cinematography in this film is overpowering. From one grand spectacle to the next, Villeneuve meets and surpasses expectations. Austin Butler makes an impression as the elite gladiaor-villain, Feyd-Rautha. Chalamet shines in this film but even he is ultimately overtaken by Zendaya as Chani, who is her own force of energy in this film and a righteous voice that does not bend with the masses. Hans Zimmer's electric score amplifies the tension, dread and wonder that dots this chapter. From breathtaking combat scenes to more intimate moments, the film is multi-faceted and riveting. Few sequels outshine the original. This one does and cements the trilogy as having made its mark. Highly recommended to all viewers, without exception.",thi sprawl potent sequel high water mark scienc fiction filmmak paul atreid chalamet join forc fremen whose advanc continu disintegr armi paul view fremen foreign other savior he regard faith mere folklor even mother ladi jessica ferguson ascend posit reverend mother but eventu paul watch moral code ethic erod rise posit ruler thi part film accentu weaken principl power accumul the cinematographi film overpow from one grand spectacl next villeneuv meet surpass expect austin butler make impress elit gladiaorvillain feydrautha chalamet shine film even ultim overtaken zendaya chani forc energi film righteou voic bend mass han zimmer electr score amplifi tension dread wonder dot chapter from breathtak combat scene intim moment film multifacet rivet few sequel outshin origin thi one cement trilog made mark highli recommend viewer without except
"This second half surpasses its predecessor, which, while fantastic, was weighed down by extensive world-building that affected its pacing. ""Dune 2"" benefits from that groundwork, allowing it to delve into Paul Atreides' hero's journey with a finesse that is as rare as it is exhilarating. The story development is masterfully executed, with each scene and character arc woven together to form a tapestry of narrative complexity and emotional depth.

The film's depiction of religious fervor is not only bold, but deeply moving. It illustrates the power of belief and how it can lead societies to both greatness and despair. This element adds a layer of depth that resonates on a very human level, making the story not just something you see, but something you feel. Tears came to my eyes several times.

Altogether, ""Dune 2"" is a masterpiece that surpasses its original in depth, pace and emotional impact. For anyone looking for a film that combines a compelling story with stunning visuals, this is a must-see. Paul's hero's journey is a moving reflection on power, faith and destiny, making ""Dune 2"" an unforgettable experience that resonates in the mind long after the credits roll.",thi second half surpass predecessor fantast weigh extens worldbuild affect pace dune benefit groundwork allow delv paul atreid hero journey finess rare exhilar the stori develop master execut scene charact arc woven togeth form tapestri narr complex emot depth the film depict religi fervor bold deepli move it illustr power belief lead societi great despair thi element add layer depth reson human level make stori someth see someth feel tear came eye sever time altogeth dune masterpiec surpass origin depth pace emot impact for anyon look film combin compel stori stun visual mustse paul hero journey move reflect power faith destini make dune unforgett experi reson mind long credit roll
I didn't think a big budget film would get the money to be made on this subject. Dune which i love as a book has now been made into a movie about what it's really about. The danger of religious fanaticism. The first part did well in setting up the background but this second half gets to the meat of the story. The battles are better and bigger and so are the sandworms. Chani Paul's girl is shown to be against the idea of Paul becoming their prophet and so is he until he gives into the inevitable. Our modern society is rendered by culture wars and like all good science fiction whenever it's set this film holds a mirror on us and our time.,i didnt think big budget film would get money made subject dune love book made movi realli the danger religi fanatic the first part well set background second half get meat stori the battl better bigger sandworm chani paul girl shown idea paul becom prophet give inevit our modern societi render cultur war like good scienc fiction whenev set film hold mirror u time
"The movie felt rushed. It felt disconnected to it's predecessor and missed to impress on a lot of areas. Sure it was visually stunning, other than there wasn't much I liked about it. Hopefully they can resurrect in the finale.

Nearly 3 hours to build something magical and incredible like they did in the first film and they dropped the ball. The acting was inconsistent and disappointing. Not sure how you flop this bad when the first film was done so right.

However that being said usually the second film of a trilogy is to build the story which they did in this film. I liked the original Dune better in this regard even though they didn't give us much. Let's see if they can close the series out properly.",the movi felt rush it felt disconnect predecessor miss impress lot area sure visual stun wasnt much i like hope resurrect final nearli hour build someth magic incred like first film drop ball the act inconsist disappoint not sure flop bad first film done right howev said usual second film trilog build stori film i like origin dune better regard even though didnt give u much let see close seri properli
"Am I the only one who found this movie flat? Yes, there is spectacle, but there's spectacle in transformers as well. This is by far Villeneuve's most ""marvel""-ish movie. I don't know how I can love the first part so much and just find the second part so utterly boring. It is so hard to CARE about any of the characters. And there was so, so much in the book that could (should?) have been used to make the plot more interesting. I'm really confused, because I was expecting a more canonic movie - with shifting alliances and a deeper dive into the mythology of the Bene Gesserit. Alia's part was a joke, it was just such a gimmick where I'm the book it's so, so essential to the overarching conflict between the Atreides / Kwisatz Gaderach and Bene Gesserit factions. There was so much there! This version for me was way too streamlined. I'm glad everyone else liked it though.",am i one found movi flat ye spectacl there spectacl transform well thi far villeneuv marvelish movi i dont know i love first part much find second part utterli bore it hard care charact and much book could use make plot interest im realli confus i expect canon movi shift allianc deeper dive mytholog bene gesserit alia part joke gimmick im book essenti overarch conflict atreid kwisatz gaderach bene gesserit faction there much thi version way streamlin im glad everyon el like though
"I decided to watch this movie with a little bit of trepidation because I was not enamored with the first Dune. And I never could figure out why. But I did sit and watch last night. And I am so glad I did. I was amazed with the world-building, the scenery, the skyline and the sets. Amazing. The story was more fulsome and interesting. I thought Josh Brolin and Austin Butler did the best acting, but Chalamet improved as the movie progressed. Zendaya was OK; nothing to write home about. I enjoyed the manipulations of the Bene Gesserit and the surprises in the Atreides family history. I plan to rewatch this movie to make sure I did not miss anything.

"Perfect in almost every detail.

Visually breathtaking; narratively airtight every step of the way; new characters (for the movie, not the source) introduced so seamlessly that you could almost believe they were in Part 1; a scale that fully captures the epic sweep of the story; a score and sound design so enveloping that you could almost believe you were there. Plus Chalamet and Zendaya. What performances, with Zendaya especially bringing to vivid life the character that has dwelt in my mind's eye for nearly 50 years.

And *that* change to a critical character arc, that was so perfectly executed that it takes only a few moments to realise that the problem was in the source's handling of that thread - and that this was part of Herbert's own critique of his work.

Absolutely masterly film making by a director at the peak of his powers.

"Dune Part Two is an epic science fiction masterpiece that confirms (if it wasn't already clear) Denis Villeneuve's film- making genius. Part One was the build up and this is the payoff. It explores the connection between Messianism, religious fundamentalism, politics and militarism in a way that mirrors our own world. But it doesn't offer any easy utopian resolution, completing a hugely satisfying arc in the hero's journey but at the same time presaging an apocalyptic holy war between the Great Families.

Every aspect of the film impresses. The design, the costumes, the tech, the music, the combat sequences, and of course the narrative, for which we can thank Frank Herbert but also screenwriters Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. When Maud'Dib and the Fremen ride on the back of the giant sandworms (Shai-Hulud) you know your watching sequences that will become cinematic classics. Bless the Maker and his water!

All of the cast are back from the first film and there are some excellent additions. Christopher Walken is the Emperor and Florence Pugh his daughter Princess Irulan. Léa Seydoux is great but a little under-utilised as Lady Margot Fenring. The standout addition is Austin Butler, fresh from his portrayal of Elvis, smashing any typecasting to pieces as Feyd-Rautha, the psychotic and sadistic champion of the Sardaukar.

One thing I love about both films is that they tell a mother and son tale. Rebecca Ferguson (as Lady Jessica) and Timothée Chalamet (as Paul Atreides) brilliantly explore the negotiated territory between a mother who sees her son in terms of her own prophetic wishes and a son who resists that vision but in the end uses it to carve out his own destiny.

If there is one criticism I have (and its only a small irritation) it's the rather poorly rendered mass crowd scenes. They are so obviously computer generated (of course) but they don't look at all real which takes you out of the world you're immersed in. That aside, I have not loved a franchise this much since The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I definitely want to see it again at the cinema. An IMAX session would be awe inspiring.

Part 2 on the other hand, is weirdly edited (veeeerry long at first and the hero moves at the speed of light sometimes..) and the esthetically perfect tableaus are no more. Scenes are as standard as can be; such as they are in any Hollywood movie. As a result, the tale I was so thrilled about becomes a regular good story.

"5 out of 5 stars.

Dune Part 2 is an awesome science fiction epic that delivers the next chapter in the series and it is one exciting cinematic experience. The director does an amazing job planning every sequence and action. Plus the visual effects are astonishing. Director Denis Villeneuve is one of the best as he plans every scene carefully and making each sequence a cinematic epic from fantastic cinematography that does great capturing the visuals and set pieces. The script is also incredible which continues with the story and world building. More new characters are introduced. Characters go through an arc. The pacing is fast. The film also felt like a middle chapter with a cliffhanger ending while tying up loose ends. Definitely excited to see another Dune 3 film by Denis Villenueve.

The cast ensemble did a great job with there performances. The music score by Hans Zimmer was beautiful. The visual effects are amazing with breathtaking set pieces. The sandworms showing up in the climatic battle was epic that needs to be seen on the biggest screen. There is more action than the first. Better pacing. And more of an epic story.

"Sometimes you are full of anticipation and when the moment is there..... you can only be disappointed. The movie is beautifully shot and de pace in most scenes is comfortable besides the action scenes, they are too fast and have no sustenance, so you are basically watching some kicking and slapping but have no idea why.

The thing that really irritated me was the lack of story and lack of chemistry between the main couple. Chalamet can act, Zendaya knows about 2-3 facial expressions, the Harkonen are just weird and the worms are, surprisingly, the stars of the show. I wish they gave the story and the cast just as must love and attention, then the movie would be at least satisfying.

Instead, this overly hyped movie is just as bad as the last avatar in which the whale-like being had more to tell then the rest of the cast.",sometim full anticip moment disappoint the movi beauti shot de pace scene comfort besid action scene fast susten basic watch kick slap idea the thing realli irrit lack stori lack chemistri main coupl chalamet act zendaya know facial express harkonen weird worm surprisingli star show i wish gave stori cast must love attent movi would least satisfi instead overli hype movi bad last avatar whalelik tell rest cast
"I always anticipated that Dune Part Two would surpass the first, a common trend in movies like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. Dune, directed by Denis Villeneuve, impressed me with its authenticity, epic storytelling, cinematography, atmosphere, and overall execution. While not flawless, the performances of the actors and actresses make any mishaps negligible. This rendition stands on its own, and I haven't felt the need to watch the 1984 version.

The characters were very interesting. We see the religion, how Paul becomes the next leader, Bardem, I love his character, he speaks with such authenticity and he makes it enjoyable. The duel between Paul vs Feyd in a silent moment with no music was insane. Those were some great moments in the film.",i alway anticip dune part two would surpass first common trend movi like harri potter lord ring star war dune direct deni villeneuv impress authent epic storytel cinematographi atmospher overal execut while flawless perform actor actress make mishap neglig thi rendit stand i havent felt need watch version the charact interest we see religion paul becom next leader bardem i love charact speak authent make enjoy the duel paul v feyd silent moment music insan those great moment film
"Dune: Part Two is the perfect example of a movie that must be seen in the cinema and not at home. The visual spectacle and design is unparalleled among sci-fi and really feels like a completely fleshed out future world (or worlds), with architecture, props and costumes that look like they were sourced from a museum rather than a Hollywood warehouse. Compared to the first film, the stakes have true gravity and the scope is much wider with far-ranging battles and conspiracies. It's hard to pinpoint any highlight as every scene is iconic, incredibly beautiful to behold and accompanied by expertly rousing music, all underscoring the central feeling of foreboding. Where would I begin? The ceremonies with the Water of Life plunge us into an ancient ritual that almost kills the drinker and reveals deep secrets that the audience only finds out in drips. Paul's terrifying vision of death and destruction (much less cheesy than in the first film) show the inner turmoil he faces as someone who is the fulcrum of the planet's destiny and resents his role but can't escape the fate set in motion by higher powers. The short scenes with the foetus are mysterious and tease at an important role to be played by her future version. Chani's frantic misgivings in the Fremen gatherings impress the deleterious effects the prophecies are having on her people and the unprecedented role of the Bene Gessarit. Princess Irulan's musings in a beautiful garden about the historical developments around her uncover just how deeply all the conspiracies extend. The scenes in the Harkonnen's world are stark and show how brutal and power-hungry they are and how formidable they can be. The actors in these scenes are perfectly cast and all impart a sense of heaviness, as if to stress just how much Spice is tied to the fate of the world, the past and the future all together. All of this combines to form an experience that immerses us in a compelling future conflict, relentlessly ratchets up in tension and constantly giving the sense that there's something even more world-shattering just around the corner.

That said, the film has a few flaws that are noticeable but not substantial enough to dent my rating of 8.5/10 (rounded to 9). Some of the characterisation is caricatured - the Harkonnens are too cartoonishly evil to be believable (how many times do we need to see them murder their own staff?), Stilgar is too fanatical to be believable (how many times do we need to see him exclaim, ""the prophet! As written!!""?), the Fremen are too invincible to be believable (did anyone ever doubt how the battles would go?) and the romance between Paul and Chani was forced. The pacing was uneven, as some scenes sped by very quickly (for example, most of the emperor's scenes), and some dragged on for no good reason (most of the times they walk or talk through the desert). Paul would have gone blind by looking directly at a nuclear explosion. The ending felt anticlimactic and was too overt in how it was setting up another sequel. Some parts of the book that are crucial to understanding the planet's history were excised, like the long-term human genetic plan and the ecological plan, which were reduced to one-line mentions. Finally, as a vexillologist, I couldn't help but notice how badly designed the flags were. One of the key principles of good flag design is simplicity, as a simple design can be recognised and remembered at a distance and when waving. Each faction has a central symbol, but their flags drown them out in a mess of visual detail, hamstringing their ability to signal at a distance and establish themselves in the audience's mind. This is a shame, as each faction has such a strong visual identity in their settings and costumes, but their symbols are not given the opportunity to shine and become iconic.

"As a fan of the original books and having enjoyed the first part of the new Dune, this was the true followup. Forget The Empire Strikes Back, sci-fi, we have a new champion! It was a little slow at the beginning but then the action picked up and I was almost instantly captivated. More action much like the RTS games from the now-gone Westwood Studios and the Fremen are back. I can hardly wait to see what's in store for the further Dune adventures. I think this is the start of a beautiful franchise. Who knows, maybe we'll get all of the Dune Chronicles as films someday. All of the actors did their jobs really well and the props and scenery were fantastic. I'd say this really rekindled my relationship with the Dune franchise. This and the first part. Thank you, everyone.

"An absolute spectacle, some stellar performances, and a soundtrack to match. The scale is astounding.

This is what cinema and sci fi is about.

There are no short cuts or cheap tricks, Villeneuve has created a fitting sequel to a great first film.

Even with such dense source material there are moments of levity and passion that must have been very difficult to pull off.

I cannot think of a sci fi film series that carries the same amount of emotional weight so well.

Many compare the original book series to Lotr, I hope this series pulls off the same amount of quality that the Lotr series enjoyed.

Am looking forward to watching this again in cinema next week.",an absolut spectacl stellar perform soundtrack match the scale astound thi cinema sci fi there short cut cheap trick villeneuv creat fit sequel great first film even den sourc materi moment leviti passion must difficult pull i cannot think sci fi film seri carri amount emot weight well mani compar origin book seri lotr i hope seri pull amount qualiti lotr seri enjoy am look forward watch cinema next week
"I didn't fully connect with the Dune universe until yesterday.

The 80's version, despite being directed by David Lynch, is a fiasco in every way.

And the first of this saga by Villeneuve did not move me enough. I felt it was lukewarm for the beginning of an interplanetary epic.

This second part corrects all the shortcomings of the previous one and is a firm and notable step that positions the saga with the potential to become something similar to what The Lord of the Rings saga achieved.

Denis Villenueve uses the concepts of the book: The Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell with mastery and narrative eloquence: The twelve stages of the hero's journey 1. Ordinary world. The real world before the story begins.

2. The call to adventure. The protagonist is presented with a problem, challenge or adventure.

3. Call rejection. Fear of change causes reluctance to accept the call, a refusal to leave the comfort zone.

4. Meeting with a mentor with supernatural help. The hero finds support that provides him with information and trains him to respond to the challenge.

5. First threshold. The ordinary world is abandoned and the threshold is crossed into the special or magical world. The hero faces what is known as the desert crossing.

6. Tests, allies and enemies. The hero encounters all kinds of trials, enemies and allies, which allows him to learn the rules of that special world.

7. Approach. The hero overcomes the tests on his path.

8. Decisive evidence. The most critical moment takes place, a life or death test.

9. Reward. The hero has faced death and overcome the fear of it, then comes the reward.

10. The way back. The protagonist has to return to the ordinary world.

11. Resurrection or Enlightenment. On the way back, another decisive test takes place on his home world, the hero once again faces death using everything he has learned. The transformation is complete.

12. Return with the elixir. The hero becomes aware of the acquired knowledge (power) that he uses to help others in the ordinary world.

It is a paradigm that has served many visionaries as a practical guide to create their alternative universes. George Lucas has mentioned on several occasions how valuable reading Campbell was to him in laying the foundation for Star Wars.

Dune 2 is visually majestic. There are memorable scenes: the giant worm cavalcades through the desert are innovative and peculiar. He knows how to take advantage of the immensity of the desert, the enigmatic nature of these extensive desert territories. The arid environment helps to understand the psychology of the characters; like Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a leader with unwavering faith.

The narrative has strong religious connotations: it speaks of a Messiah, of prophecies, of mystical rituals that lead to the knowledge of profound truth, of religious fundamentalism. At the same time and inherent to any power struggle, subtle political intrigue is handled to strengthen positions and implement military strategies.

All these aspects are masterfully brought together. A film of almost three hours that does not falter at any time. On the contrary, as it progresses, interest increases and narrative cohesion grows.

A wonderful cast: Timotheé Chamalet as Paul Atreides, the son of an important house banished by circumstances and who, in adversity, finds the clarity and inner strength to become a leader and a kind of messiah. Rebecca Ferguson, as Jessica, his mother, who becomes a spiritual leader known as Reverend Mother.

Florence Pugh, as Princess Irulan, who will witness the collapse of the power of her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken). That is to say, all the characters are attractive and well drawn. They feel organic and do not merely represent archetypes.

Everything works fine here. The audiovisual gear provides spectacle with strong foundations supported by a deep story that makes allegories to religious and socio-political problems current in the 21st century.",i didnt fulli connect dune univers yesterday the version despit direct david lynch fiasco everi way and first saga villeneuv move enough i felt lukewarm begin interplanetari epic thi second part correct shortcom previou one firm notabl step posit saga potenti becom someth similar the lord ring saga achiev deni villenuev use concept book the hero journey joseph campbel masteri narr eloqu the twelv stage hero journey ordinari world the real world stori begin the call adventur the protagonist present problem challeng adventur call reject fear chang caus reluct accept call refus leav comfort zone meet mentor supernatur help the hero find support provid inform train respond challeng first threshold the ordinari world abandon threshold cross special magic world the hero face known desert cross test alli enemi the hero encount kind trial enemi alli allow learn rule special world approach the hero overcom test path decis evid the critic moment take place life death test reward the hero face death overcom fear come reward the way back the protagonist return ordinari world resurrect enlighten on way back anoth decis test take place home world hero face death use everyth learn the transform complet return elixir the hero becom awar acquir knowledg power use help other ordinari world it paradigm serv mani visionari practic guid creat altern univers georg luca mention sever occas valuabl read campbel lay foundat star war dune visual majest there memor scene giant worm cavalcad desert innov peculiar he know take advantag immens desert enigmat natur extens desert territori the arid environ help understand psycholog charact like stilgar javier bardem leader unwav faith the narr strong religi connot speak messiah propheci mystic ritual lead knowledg profound truth religi fundament at time inher power struggl subtl polit intrigu handl strengthen posit implement militari strategi all aspect master brought togeth a film almost three hour falter time on contrari progress interest increas narr cohes grow a wonder cast timoth chamalet paul atreid son import hous banish circumst advers find clariti inner strength becom leader kind messiah rebecca ferguson jessica mother becom spiritu leader known reverend mother florenc pugh princess irulan wit collaps power father emperor christoph walken that say charact attract well drawn they feel organ mere repres archetyp everyth work fine the audiovisu gear provid spectacl strong foundat support deep stori make allegori religi sociopolit problem current st centuri
"Too many grand entries, too much emphasis on minute movements in the heat of a fight and drifting frames for calm scenes make it boring towards the end. It is hard to stay put and concentrate on he story. A lot of little things were included which made the bigger things less important. The translation of the book was too close literary and thus was confusing, the essence lost. It felt like a dogged translation. A little distance from the book would have helped.

Also a unique story would have been nice if nothing else was working. With such amazing actors what couldn't you have done.

"An absolute masterpiece.

Please note, there are no plot spoilers in this review, but I will talk about some of the main themes.

Okay, so...

Dune: Part Two is one of the best films I've ever had the pleasure to see in a theater. I saw it in dual laser IMAX, and will see it again in 70mm IMAX. Dune: Part Two might have some of the most incredible sound mixing I've ever heard, too, at least for a spectacle and an epic. You feel it in your bones.

The real reason this film is so exceptional isn't the world class filmmaking and visuals, though. It's the fact that this is a multi-layered and complex story that easily could have turned into a tedious slog, but it doesn't. In fact, ignore the fact that this is sci-fi for a moment. This story deals with some of the most interesting and universal themes imaginable. Fanaticism, faith, religion, power, love, tribalism, the rise and fall of empires. It takes an incredibly dense mythology and puts that to screen THROUGH its visuals, not in spite of them. This is how you properly adapt something from words to images.

Also, look around at the world today. The themes of this story are as relevant as they've ever been. At heart, even though this is a sci-fi story, it deals with human psychology at its most primal levels. Clearly inspired by the Middle East and the Abrahamic religions, especially Islam (and also Judaism around the time of the Second Temple and early Christianity and the Bar Kokhba revolt), Dune manages to offer the same warning of the books, in perhaps an even more visceral and direct way...

Beware of saviors.

Holy wars have shaped the real world, yet so many sci-fi stories shy away from dealing with concepts of faith and religion. By embracing this aspect of the novels, this adaptation finds greatness. Especially among other blockbusters, this really is a unique experience. And it isn't done in a simplistic or insulting way, either. The best stories make you think and force you to engage with them, and there are layers to the characters and their struggles.

This is not to say Dune: Part Two is perfect. I actually wish it was longer. The last third is a little rushed, and I love Christopher Walken but he may have been a little miscast here. However, the overall film is so exceptional, and it reaches such rarefied heights (like LOTR and Lawrence of Arabia before it), that it doesn't really matter to me that much. With that said, I've also only seen the film once so far, and am curious how repeat viewings will affect my thoughts.

Also, I wish this had been made like LOTR, so Dune Messiah was coming out next year. Alas, I get why Denis needs a break from making three epics back-to-back-to-back.

Speaking of, Denis is up there with the best to ever do it. Incendies, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Polytechnique, Sicario. Like the best filmmakers he has such range, but each film is so unquestionably his work.",an absolut masterpiec plea note plot spoiler review i talk main theme okay dune part two one best film ive ever pleasur see theater i saw dual laser imax see mm imax dune part two might incred sound mix ive ever heard least spectacl epic you feel bone the real reason film except isnt world class filmmak visual though it fact multilay complex stori easili could turn tediou slog doesnt in fact ignor fact scifi moment thi stori deal interest univers theme imagin fanatic faith religion power love tribal rise fall empir it take incred den mytholog put screen through visual spite thi properli adapt someth word imag also look around world today the theme stori relev theyv ever at heart even though scifi stori deal human psycholog primal level clearli inspir middl east abraham religion especi islam also judaism around time second templ earli christian bar kokhba revolt dune manag offer warn book perhap even viscer direct way bewar savior holi war shape real world yet mani scifi stori shi away deal concept faith religion by embrac aspect novel adapt find great especi among blockbust realli uniqu experi and isnt done simplist insult way either the best stori make think forc engag layer charact struggl thi say dune part two perfect i actual wish longer the last third littl rush i love christoph walken may littl miscast howev overal film except reach rarefi height like lotr lawrenc arabia doesnt realli matter much with said ive also seen film far curiou repeat view affect thought also i wish made like lotr dune messiah come next year ala i get deni need break make three epic backtobacktoback speak deni best ever incendi arriv blade runner polytechniqu sicario like best filmmak rang film unquestion work
"Just watched the movie.

The visuals and music were top notch. Story was good(i haven't read the book , so can't compare)

Tbh some time jumps felt out of place.

The ending was good but i think we could have gotten more battle elements and I felt it short.

Overall I would rate it 7.5 /10

It's worth watching in the big screen especially the visuals are so amazing it felt like there were actually planets like Arrakis

"The first dune in this series is one of my favourite movies ever and I came out of this one feeling mega let down.

The worst part for me the characters. Paul's curious and innocent heart gave him balance and in this one I feel they took him to an extreme that made him unrelatable. The best quality of the fremen in the first movie was their myteriousness and strength in this movie they came off as unintelligent and weak which didn't make sense to me. The mom's wisdom seemed to completely disappear in this one too which I found also made her unrelatable.

I thought the pace of this one didn't allow for the magic and mysteriousness of the story to shine through.",the first dune seri one favourit movi ever i came one feel mega let the worst part charact paul curiou innoc heart gave balanc one i feel took extrem made unrelat the best qualiti fremen first movi myteri strength movi came unintellig weak didnt make sen the mom wisdom seem complet disappear one i found also made unrelat i thought pace one didnt allow magic mysteri stori shine
"Dune Part 2 continues to build upon the greatness of the first movie and even surpasses it. The visuals of the movie from planet to planet all stand in stark contrast and the color palettes used only make every scene that much better.

The acting is always superb and the relationship that is build between the main characters is extremely well made, for lovers of the book they can be happy because this film does it justice.

Thus if you like sci-fi or grand story telling this is the movie for you, the films might be long but it's so worth it. When it was over i couldn't believe it had actually been that long, it only felt like an hour on the first watch.

Coming into Dune Part Two on day 2 of it's UK wide release and having already seen the unwavering reviews I was in high anticipation for what I believed could be the triumph in cinema we have been needing for quite some time. A feat that could actually set me up for disappointment. However, true to the words of my predecessors who saw the film before me, it was simply otherworldly.

Denis is a visionary. A creative mind that only comes around in Hollywood once in a blue moon. This film is beautiful, it's vivid, it's dense in all the best ways.

"Well, this one has a lot more flow in it than the first one. Still there are parts where people are left wondering why they are added, but are quite much less than what was in the first movie.

The battles were more moving and more detailed. The story was more directed. Still there was bloat, but was more or less acceptable.

The story was once again predictable and was easy to foresee the end of the movie. In details actually. Actually I am quite sure what will happen in the third movie without ever reading the books or watching the old version of the movie.

The parts that made me laugh as they were ridiculous and just not logical (like the part where they run 100m in the sand to hid, while leaving a clear trail behind to be found) were scattered.

Overall, enjoyable movie but doubt I will watch it again.",well one lot flow first one still part peopl left wonder ad quit much less first movi the battl move detail the stori direct still bloat less accept the stori predict easi forese end movi in detail actual actual i quit sure happen third movi without ever read book watch old version movi the part made laugh ridicul logic like part run sand hid leav clear trail behind found scatter overal enjoy movi doubt i watch
"This movie is absolutely incredible and breathtaking. I thought Dune Part One was slow paced in trying to present the set-up for the rest of the story and made it boring for me. While the movie is still a bit slow-paced, thankfully this part is a massive improvement. The story finally feels like it's going somewhere and it's great to be along for the ride. I never felt bored and was honestly entertained the entire two and a half hour length.

The movie is absolutely stunning in its cinematography and is one of the greatest visual spectacles I've ever seen. Especially since the whole movie is essentially sand that really says something to how impressive it looks. And the sound. Oh, baby, the sound. Whoever worked on the sound editing/mixing really deserves a medal. The score by Hans Zimmer is nothing short of amazing. Not every part is a masterpiece but when it needs to shine it really does. A theater experience is something I won't ever regret when watching this movie. Timothee and Zendaya did pretty good and so did the other performers. It's honestly really difficult for me to think of a valid criticism. It's borderline Lord of the Rings good; that's how amazing this film is. Honestly would not mind an extended 4 hour version.

(So didnt take long ) She is a terrible actress and ruined the whole movie. She was never even that great on Disney so I'm not to sure why people keep hiring her? For the reaction I guess?

"More of the same great stuff that ""Part One"" had in it, only more expansive, more explosive, faster paced, and, somehow mixed in with all that, much more intimate. Villenueve chose to alter (at least) two main characters from the book, one in a subtle way and the other dramatically, but it didn't take much away from the gist of Herbert's written work and served to keep the momentum of the movie going.

I've always wondered how movie directors choose what to cut from novels they adapt to the big screen, or what they choose to keep in but change significantly. I respect what the director did here; ""Part Two"" felt much more emotive and touching to me than the first part, while still presenting those jaw-dropping cinematic moments (a right-of-passage the main character goes through with a sandworm reminded me of that canyon run scene from ""Top Gun: Maverick"").

All in all, this has instantly become the definitive ""Dune"" film adaptation, with or without future movies coming out in the franchise, and I feel lucky to be alive at a time I can see them in the theater.",more great stuff part one expans explos faster pace somehow mix much intim villenuev chose alter least two main charact book one subtl way dramat didnt take much away gist herbert written work serv keep momentum movi go ive alway wonder movi director choos cut novel adapt big screen choos keep chang significantli i respect director part two felt much emot touch first part still present jawdrop cinemat moment rightofpassag main charact goe sandworm remind canyon run scene top gun maverick all instantli becom definit dune film adapt without futur movi come franchis i feel lucki aliv time i see theater
"Science Fiction is a notoriously difficult genre to do well, and like Horror, can often be divisive with audiences. The first Dune was a great film, but common criticisms were that is was slow, dry and somewhat shallow. Dune: Part Two is none of these things. It is a truly spectacular movie-going experience that treats the source material with a great deal of reverence while also not being afraid to do its own thing. But what is perhaps this movie's greatest strength is that it treats it audience with some level of respect. It doesn't shy away from its sci-fi roots, and doesn't attempt to pad itself with unnecessary humour or sarcasm in an attempt to make itself more palatable. Dune 2 believes in itself, and its audience, and the end result is a gripping, beautiful, haunting film that will surely become a classic.

The visuals, as usual, are spectacular. There are some sequences in this film that were so visually stunning that I am still thinking of them days after. The music, cinematography, set design, audio design and costuming are all on another level in this movie. Everything about it feels grandiose and sumptuous, and you can tell a great deal of care was taken to make this movie as beautiful as possible.

Story and acting wise, Dune also impresses. While the movie does stray from the book and alter some plot points, the spirit of Dune and its message are prescient throughout. The middle of the movie does sag somewhat, and pacing issues may be one of my few criticisms of Dune: Part Two, but it's a minor issue that doesn't really effect the quality of the overall product too much. Timothee Chalamet shines here, and I was pleasantly surprised at just how believable he was as a dangerous Messiah-like figure. He sold the transformation incredibly well. Rebecca Ferguson is also at her best here, and my only complaint is that she isn't in the movie more.

Other shining stars are Austin Butler, who is a magnificent choice for Fayd-Rautha, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, who provides some light brevity, and Charlotte Rampling who is fantastic as always. Florence Pugh, Lea Sideoux, Dave Bautista and Zendaya also give great performances. Christopher Walken is really showing his age in this movie, unfortunately, and I did feel that his portrayal of the Emperor lacked the gravitas that the role demanded.

I highly recommend Dune: Part Two. It's an amazing film made with a great deal of care, and you can tell that Dennis truly respects and loves the source material he is adapting. I would recommend that you watch this movie in theatres, it's an amazing experience. If you can find a theatre with either IMAX or Dolby Atmos, you will have an amazing time.

"I didn't know that story about white Skinheads (Harkonnen) with help of trailer people / white trash (Sardukar) vs Diverse desert people (Fremen) can be executed so perfectly.

Anyway, this is best adaptation in my opinion.

Story is rich and character development is great.

Acting is great and immersive.

We are in a time when movies usually lack depth and good storytelling so this is actually really refreshing.

It is the only movie which I watched in cinema in a very long time. I just didn't see anything worth spending money and time. Dune PT2 did not disappoint me and I think even people who knew nothing about Dune lore could engage.

"Dune2 is the perfect adaptation of the book and it delivered the best cinematic experience a sci fi movie can deliver.

Camera, art, cinematography, VFX all are in the benchmark territory This movie need to be watched from the imax theatre for the best experience.

In the vast and unforgiving sands of Arrakis, a tale of power, prophecy, and survival unfolds in the epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction masterpiece, ""Dune."" Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this cinematic triumph delivers an unparalleled experience, particularly when viewed in the immersive setting of an IMAX theater. As audiences are transported to the far reaches of the universe, they are treated to a visual and auditory spectacle that elevates the already captivating narrative to new heights.

From the moment the opening credits roll, ""Dune"" plunges viewers into a richly realized world of political intrigue and ancient prophecy. Villeneuve's masterful direction and Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography combine to create a visually stunning landscape that feels both familiar and alien. In IMAX, every sweeping vista of the desert planet Arrakis and every intricately detailed costume and set piece come to life with unparalleled clarity and depth, immersing audiences in a sensory experience unlike any other.

At the heart of ""Dune"" lies a sprawling epic that follows the journey of Paul Atreides, played with depth and nuance by Timothée Chalamet. As the young scion of House Atreides, Paul finds himself thrust into a dangerous game of politics and power on Arrakis, where control of the planet's most valuable resource, spice, hangs in the balance. Chalamet's portrayal captures the complex inner turmoil of a young man torn between duty and destiny, as he grapples with his newfound role as the chosen one of prophecy.

The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother Lady Jessica, Oscar Isaac as his father Duke Leto, and Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, further enriches the tapestry of characters. Each actor brings depth and humanity to their roles, elevating the ensemble cast to new heights and ensuring that even the most minor characters leave a lasting impression on the audience.

What sets ""Dune"" apart from other sci-fi epics is its meticulous attention to detail and richly textured world-building. Villeneuve and his team have crafted a universe that feels lived-in and authentic, from the intricate politics of the Great Houses to the customs and traditions of the desert-dwelling Fremen. In IMAX, every minute detail is brought to life with stunning clarity, allowing audiences to immerse themselves fully in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants.

But ""Dune"" is more than just a visually spectacular blockbuster; it is also a thought-provoking exploration of themes such as power, religion, and ecology. Herbert's novel, upon which the film is based, is renowned for its depth and complexity, and Villeneuve does justice to the source material by crafting a narrative that is both faithful to its roots and accessible to newcomers. In IMAX, the film's grand themes are brought into sharp relief, inviting audiences to ponder the nature of destiny and the consequences of our actions on the world around us.

In conclusion, ""Dune"" is a cinematic triumph that delivers the perfect IMAX experience. Denis Villeneuve's visionary direction, coupled with stunning visuals and powerhouse performances, creates an epic saga that will leave audiences breathless. Whether you're a fan of the original novel or simply seeking a thrilling cinematic experience, ""Dune"" is not to be missed. Strap in, hold on tight, and prepare to be transported to a world beyond imagination.",dune perfect adapt book deliv best cinemat experi sci fi movi deliv camera art cinematographi vfx benchmark territori thi movi need watch imax theatr best experi in vast unforgiv sand arraki tale power propheci surviv unfold epic adapt frank herbert semin scienc fiction masterpiec dune direct visionari filmmak deni villeneuv cinemat triumph deliv unparallel experi particularli view immers set imax theater a audienc transport far reach univers treat visual auditori spectacl elev alreadi captiv narr new height from moment open credit roll dune plung viewer richli realiz world polit intrigu ancient propheci villeneuv master direct roger deakin breathtak cinematographi combin creat visual stun landscap feel familiar alien in imax everi sweep vista desert planet arraki everi intric detail costum set piec come life unparallel clariti depth immers audienc sensori experi unlik at heart dune lie sprawl epic follow journey paul atreid play depth nuanc timoth chalamet a young scion hous atreid paul find thrust danger game polit power arraki control planet valuabl resourc spice hang balanc chalamet portray captur complex inner turmoil young man torn duti destini grappl newfound role chosen one propheci the support cast includ rebecca ferguson paul mother ladi jessica oscar isaac father duke leto zendaya mysteri fremen warrior chani enrich tapestri charact each actor bring depth human role elev ensembl cast new height ensur even minor charact leav last impress audienc what set dune apart scifi epic meticul attent detail richli textur worldbuild villeneuv team craft univers feel livedin authent intric polit great hous custom tradit desertdwel fremen in imax everi minut detail brought life stun clariti allow audienc immers fulli world arraki inhabit but dune visual spectacular blockbust also thoughtprovok explor theme power religion ecolog herbert novel upon film base renown depth complex villeneuv justic sourc materi craft narr faith root access newcom in imax film grand theme brought sharp relief invit audienc ponder natur destini consequ action world around u in conclus dune cinemat triumph deliv perfect imax experi deni villeneuv visionari direct coupl stun visual powerhous perform creat epic saga leav audienc breathless whether your fan origin novel simpli seek thrill cinemat experi dune miss strap hold tight prepar transport world beyond imagin

"Bottom line first. This film, unlike Part One, is less Dune and more Dune-Adjacent. While the first film adhered somewhat closely to the storyline of Frank Herbert's book, this section wildly veers away from the source material. It would be more accurate to say it is a film adaptation using characters and some situation from the book. It also depends on spectacle rather than storytelling.

Timothée Chalamet is again reasonably good as Paul. I am continually surprised and impressed by his range and ability.

Zendaya is also quite good. Sadly, she is hampered by Chani being written a minor secondary character.

The rest are... adequate.

Dune has a rich story with significant subtext. Sadly, director Denis Villeneuve relys far too heavily on spectacle resulting in a film that is pretty, but not at all important. This is not unexpected. He has a long history of almost-great near misses. Make no mistake, he is good, and has awards that speak to that, but he is nowhere near great. And he could be.

The costuming is good, but the characters are continually shown wearing partial stillsuits. At times, they are outside without one at all. No Fremen in their right minds would ever do this. I realize you need to show the principals faces and such, but good directors and costumers would find acceptable workarounds.

Special effect are good. Again, the concentration is on spectacle.

One more thing! The Stunt Actors are brilliant! The entire Stunt Crew deserves the greatest of praise. Their work alone adds a Star to the film. Good Job All.

"Honestly, I don't get it - this movie is slow, has very little story to it (yes great special effects!), is super amazing boring and really doesn't go into any depth with the story telling. Not sure if it's me and I have too many expectations or it's simply flat as most movies are nowadays. This is definitely NOT a brilliant movie that replaces (as the producers said) Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back... it's a special effect expanded movie that could have been shortening down to basically an hour. Really don't get it why people are so excited about it. At least, not me and I'm open minded.",honestli i dont get movi slow littl stori ye great special effect super amaz bore realli doesnt go depth stori tell not sure i mani expect simpli flat movi nowaday thi definit not brilliant movi replac produc said star war empir strike back special effect expand movi could shorten basic hour realli dont get peopl excit at least im open mind
"As a Dune book series fan myself, I was very hyped for the second Dune part. I already loved the first movie, so I had very high expectations in the second part, and there were highly exceeded.

The first two seconds of the film, Power over spice, is power over all. Already set the tone for the movie, and with great scenery, fantastic acting and incredible sound and music, Villeneuve created one of my favorite movies forever.

One little thing that annoyed me was the inaccurate representation of Chani and the Fremen traditions. I understand where it comes from, but Chani being less supportive of Paul and tending more to side with the non-believers was a little bit inaccurate.

Nevertheless, the movie represented the book very closely, and I had so much fun watching, thank you!",a dune book seri fan i hype second dune part i alreadi love first movi i high expect second part highli exceed the first two second film power spice power alreadi set tone movi great sceneri fantast act incred sound music villeneuv creat one favorit movi forev one littl thing annoy inaccur represent chani fremen tradit i understand come chani less support paul tend side nonbeliev littl bit inaccur nevertheless movi repres book close i much fun watch thank

This movie will hook and grab your attention from the beginning. Dune; Part 2 delivers on promises made from the first movie and has you gripped all the way to the end.

Everyone that has worked on this movie should be incredibly proud of what they have accomplished! The director's vision, scope and style for the Dune movies are nothing but glorious and beautiful. The cinematography done suits it so perfectly to capture its scale and tone.

"I doubt I'm alone in feeling that part one was great but ended right when it was about to leave the chain. Part two broke it and ran. I personally love it when the setting feels like a character in the movie and the desert is that in this one. Timothy Chalamet gives a performance beyond his young age. Zendaya does well and has a much larger part to play here. The direction by Denis is almost flawless and some shots are pure art.

Not much to say on the negative side. The third act feels rushed quite a bit. Act one and two move along at the same pace as all of part one, then it feels like the end is forced like someone was looking over his shoulder to finish up. This is a grand movie with a grand scope from grand source material and it shows.

What a massive undertaking. It must be so hard to film in a desert, with sand gumming up the technology but you'd never know by watching Dune. It just feels like you are there with them all.

"Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal novel reaches its zenith with ""Dune: Part Two,"" a stunning continuation that not only lives up to its predecessor but expands upon it in profound ways. Building upon the intricate world-building and character development established in the first installment, ""Dune: Part Two"" delves even deeper into the complex politics, rich mythology, and existential themes that define Herbert's universe.

Visually breathtaking and intellectually stimulating, the film immerses viewers once again in the harsh yet mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis, brought to life with awe-inspiring cinematography and meticulous attention to detail. From the vast deserts to the towering sandworms, every frame feels like a work of art, elevating the epic scope of the story.

The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances across the board, with Timothée Chalamet reprising his role as the conflicted hero Paul Atreides with captivating intensity. Zendaya shines as the enigmatic Chani, while Oscar Isaac brings gravitas to the role of Duke Leto Atreides. New additions to the cast, including Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, further enrich the tapestry of characters, each adding depth and complexity to the narrative.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its exploration of power, identity, and destiny. As Paul grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his prophesied role as the Kwisatz Haderach, the film delves into themes of agency, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding immense power. Villeneuve deftly navigates these weighty themes, crafting a story that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.

Furthermore, ""Dune: Part Two"" maintains a brisk pace despite its lengthy runtime, keeping audiences engaged with its riveting plot twists and visceral action sequences. The film strikes a perfect balance between spectacle and substance, offering both heart-pounding thrills and moments of quiet introspection.

While ""Dune: Part Two"" may not provide all the answers or neatly tie up every narrative thread, it sets the stage for an epic conclusion that is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the final installment. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, ""Dune: Part Two"" solidifies Villeneuve's adaptation as a modern sci-fi masterpiece.",deni villeneuv ambiti adapt frank herbert semin novel reach zenith dune part two stun continu live predecessor expand upon profound way build upon intric worldbuild charact develop establish first instal dune part two delv even deeper complex polit rich mytholog existenti theme defin herbert univers visual breathtak intellectu stimul film immers viewer harsh yet mesmer landscap arraki brought life aweinspir cinematographi meticul attent detail from vast desert tower sandworm everi frame feel like work art elev epic scope stori the ensembl cast deliv outstand perform across board timoth chalamet repris role conflict hero paul atreid captiv intens zendaya shine enigmat chani oscar isaac bring gravita role duke leto atreid new addit cast includ javier bardem stilgar rebecca ferguson ladi jessica enrich tapestri charact ad depth complex narr one film greatest strength lie explor power ident destini a paul grappl newfound abil weight prophesi role kwisatz haderach film delv theme agenc sacrific consequ wield immens power villeneuv deftli navig weighti theme craft stori thoughtprovok emot reson furthermor dune part two maintain brisk pace despit lengthi runtim keep audienc engag rivet plot twist viscer action sequenc the film strike perfect balanc spectacl substanc offer heartpound thrill moment quiet introspect while dune part two may provid answer neatli tie everi narr thread set stage epic conclus sure leav audienc eagerli anticip final instal with stun visual compel perform thoughtprovok theme dune part two solidifi villeneuv adapt modern scifi masterpiec
"Since the first part of Dune (2021), Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson-about as tough a lady as ever depicted besides Lady Macbeth) join the native tribe of Fremen on sandy planet Arrakis after being clobbered by the family of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). We know more than ambition is involved, viz., spice, a mind-opening drug and fuel (damn good stuff, I'd guess).

The Freman leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem-always room for more of his talent), believes Paul is their Messiah to defeat the Harkonnen and their eventual new leader, Feyed (Austin Butler, sans hair and guitar but with a very bald head and bloody cudgel). Paul readily assimilates with Fremen and totally assimilates with Freman Chani (Zendaya),

Paul may be an outsider, but then so was Christ, except that Paul (and Biblical Paul) is reluctant and Christ not so much. With romance developing between Paul and Chani, the allusion to Christ steps aside except for those who think there's more to the Jesus and Mary Magdalene friendship. Anyway, it's classic salvation by an outsider ( consider, if you will, the US and Vietnam).

The special effects are what makes this epic film about as beautiful as any you will ever see, which includes riding monstrous worms and a tank bigger and more nimble than any you have ever seen. While the landscape has an inherent greyness much of the time, director Dennis Villeneuve invites comparison to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia from the blistering landscapes to the blue eyes. Even the worm's magic elixir is arrestingly blue.

The conflicting interests go beyond Arrakis as Emperor Shaddam IV (underused Christopher Walken) and his hip daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), involve themselves in the dynamic and dangerous political scene. As for the Spice, the Harkonnen clan have already begun renewing production while Fremen want the opposite- a hot mess.

The visual splendor and intricate politics return in yet a third epical rendering, Dune: Messiah.

"I really liked Part 1.

I liked it so much that immediately ordered and read the first book.

Now Part 2 was technically and visually stunning but that's all...everything else was just mediocrity.

The movie it self was boring, most scenes looked rushed and didn't explain much about the plot.

The main characters where really dull and uninteresting. Except maybe Stilgar.

The Harkonnens were shown like absolute freaks and psychotic. Why?

Both Chalamet's and Zedaya's performances were surprisingly weak. Maybe their are good enough for kids type of movies like Spiderman but for an epic of this proportion they both showed that they are absolutely unsuitable.

I don't think I'm going to watch again it any time soon.

"I recently watched Dune 2, and I must say, I wasn't very impressed. Unless you're an avid Dune fan or have read the book, it's quite difficult to follow. A significant issue is the lack of a recap of the first film at the start, which leaves viewers who haven't recently watched Dune 1 at a disadvantage.

Many book adaptations stray too far from the novel, but Dune 2 appears to have the opposite problem. It seems to follow the novel so closely at times that it fails as a movie. The film feels episodic and lacks a coherent rhythm or pace. Hardcore sci-fi enthusiasts might love it, but for the average ""generalist"" movie watcher, it's a hard slog.

From a narrative perspective, the film is overly dark and lacks the lighter moments that bring contrast to a story. This results in a plot that feels flat and one-dimensional. Overall, Dune 2 might satisfy die-hard fans of the series, but it falls short for those seeking a more balanced and engaging cinematic experience.",i recent watch dune i must say i wasnt impress unless your avid dune fan read book quit difficult follow a signific issu lack recap first film start leav viewer havent recent watch dune disadvantag mani book adapt stray far novel dune appear opposit problem it seem follow novel close time fail movi the film feel episod lack coher rhythm pace hardcor scifi enthusiast might love averag generalist movi watcher hard slog from narr perspect film overli dark lack lighter moment bring contrast stori thi result plot feel flat onedimension overal dune might satisfi diehard fan seri fall short seek balanc engag cinemat experi
"If Herbert's perception of the superego of the human species was expressed in writing in a savage and crude way, Villeneuve expresses the same in words and images in a brutal and overwhelming way. Devastating charges, atomic bombs detonated at the foot of the impregnable mountains of politics, religion, power, money and the manipulation of basic instincts such as sex and genetic reproduction of the elites over the people and individuals, demonstrating that they are just small grains of sand mounted on top of each other, demonstrating that fear kills reason and prevents any negotiation if it is not supported by brute force.",if herbert percept superego human speci express write savag crude way villeneuv express word imag brutal overwhelm way devast charg atom bomb deton foot impregn mountain polit religion power money manipul basic instinct sex genet reproduct elit peopl individu demonstr small grain sand mount top demonstr fear kill reason prevent negoti support brute forc

"Such a quality not seen since Nolan's work, Denis once again proved his mystic ability to bring forth sci-fi in such ways rendering one's mind dwelling within the movie itself. Watching this movie in a format other than IMAX is deemed a crime and insult to the strenuous work of M. Villeneuve. Hats off to Austin Butler a performance mirroring that of great actors such as Heath Ledger. And the cast provided us with a determination to the success of perhaps the best sci-fi movie of the year.

"This movie experience has been unlike anything I have ever experienced inside a movie theater before and I have been blown away by Christopher Nolan a few times and I thought he had no equal when it comes to spectacle and storytelling on the biggest screens possible until Denis Villeneuve. First prisoners impressed me followed by sicario but then the stunning bladerunner2049 showed me Denis is the real deal. Then he made dune part one which already cracked my all time top 5 and solidified my belief Denis may be the best blockbuster filmmaker of this generation including Nolan. Dune Part 2 was another experience entirely, it was the most profound and powerful movie experience I've ever had in a theater before. This film made me feel everything it had to say with such massive and grand world building but yet so intimate. Part 2 was such a visceral and intense experience that I've always hoped to see one day in a theater and I now have finally tasted that experience firsthand and I feel blessed to have experienced it. I've seen it twice now and it was the same but different feeling each time.

"Firstly, Dune: Past One was a really great achievement: it was well paced according to the book adaptation; conveyed the essence of the part of the book it chose to tell; and captured a great atmosphere with great acting. Kudos to the actors and everyone involved.

Dune: Part Two in comparison is a bit of a mess. The 8.5+ rating almost implies that this current generation has succumbed to CGI effects and shallow impact scenes to override great storytelling and pacing. This movie tried to compact a significantly large portion of the book into an incoherent mess. At one point in the movie, I thought they had skipped scenes because of how all over the place it was. One minute you're in an important relationship scene between Chani and Paul, the next there's some random action scene.

It felt very rushed and incoherent. This would have been much better as a series or mini series where the story could be fleshed out and built up as it was in the books. Don't get me wrong, books are books and movies are movies, but there's a right and wrong way of treating the book material.

"It was one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen!

It was obvious that most of the stories were squeezed into the second movie, but this gave us the audience the opportunity to see much more characters, moments and events. I'm sure we are all very happy about it :)

When we compare it with the first movie; I can clearly say that they tried to tell more stories in the first movie, but this movie has more action and plot integrity. Having newly introduced characters and telling their stories was also a very important detail.

I will really wait for the third movie with curiosity, it is clear that the quality will increase exponentially with each movie.",it one incred movi ive ever seen it obviou stori squeez second movi gave u audienc opportun see much charact moment event im sure happi when compar first movi i clearli say tri tell stori first movi movi action plot integr have newli introduc charact tell stori also import detail i realli wait third movi curio clear qualiti increas exponenti movi
"My first IMDB review is dedicated to a sci-fi masterpiece that demands the attention of every enthusiast. This cinematic gem transcends expectations, weaving a visual tapestry of extraordinary beauty. From meticulously crafted scenes to stunning settings, the film's visual allure is unparalleled. The soundtrack, a character in itself, elevates the experience, creating a symphony of emotions.

Adapting from the source material, the filmmakers strike a delicate balance, preserving the essence of the book while infusing unique cinematic charm. The cast delivers authentic performances, breathing life into characters with dedication and skill. This isn't just a film; it's an experience that lingers, sparking conversations and leaving a lasting impression.

In a saturated cinematic landscape, this movie distinguishes itself as a shining star, demanding attention and offering an odyssey into the extraordinary. It's more than a movie; it's a celebration of storytelling's boundless possibilities and the artistry that makes cinema timeless.

"Dune Part II was a cinematic masterpiece meant for the big screen. Timothee Chalamet did amazing in his transformation to a believable bad***. Zendaya made an amazing duo with Chalamet. Such a star-studded cast, and the performances were universally good. The pacing was engaging, the feelings were palpable, and the whole theatre was in rapture. You could hear a pin drop in certain scenes, and there was resounding laughter in other scenes. And don't even get me started talking about the musical score! The music (and sometimes lack thereof) is so well paired and timed. This is a MUST SEE film. I will definitely be rewatching for years to come.

"The cinematography and direction is excellent. The special effects as amazing as part 1, The star cast does justice too. I felt the movie was slower than its predecessor and I was disappointed in that towards the end premise turned out to be holy war. The way the storyline took turn to religious-belief type war was disappointing. This is where the movie lost couple of stars for me.

The politics is interesting but nothing new and I was hoping for an avataresque storyline or better to ensure the wow factor. They way it's headed for the part 3 where the endgame would be the big war is a typical sci-fi ending, was a disappointing revelation.",the cinematographi direct excel the special effect amaz part the star cast justic i felt movi slower predecessor i disappoint toward end premis turn holi war the way storylin took turn religiousbelief type war disappoint thi movi lost coupl star the polit interest noth new i hope avataresqu storylin better ensur wow factor they way head part endgam would big war typic scifi end disappoint revel
"I'm a huge sci-fi fan, read Dune, loved the first movie and I was expecting a masterpiece from this one and to be honest... I was really disappointed. The second act, the middle of the movie, is so incredibly boring I was checking my watch asking myself how is this even possible that I don't enjoy it.

The cinematography, the actors and actresses, the language, the battles are all amazing but as I said there is this part in the middle with the Harkonnens and the Fremens that was a nice type of back story but it was going on and on and on.

After the end of the movie I could not believe it that I didn't enjoy the movie.

Can't believe people actually watch this. That's it!

The rest of my message is to have the the minimum amount of characters for the review to be accepted by the system.

The only good thing about this movie is technical execution. Good picture, good sound quality, good visual effects, convincing virtual elements, and so on.

I have seen the first part as well, which was a little bit better that this second part.

"After the credits began rolling, I just sat there, absolutely energized about what I just watched.

""Dune: Part Two"" is easily one of, if not THE BEST Sci-Fi movie of the 21st century!

Denis Villeneuve left the bar very high up after 2021's first Dune. This movie easily crosses that bar and puts it even higher above. It's a masterclass of film making with a visual and accoustic experience that will leave you delighted to your core. Every shot is grand, larger-than-life film making, and certainly shows every little dime of its budget, as does its set design, costumes, make-up, effect work, sound, and the INCREDIBLE score by Hans Zimmer. An epic piece of cinema we haven't seen since the Lord of the Rings movies over 20 years ago.

It wouldn't work though without an fitting cast. Timothée Chalamet delivers a presence I didn't think was possible. Zendaya does a lot of heavy lifting, while Javier Bardem mixes his amazing role as the true believer Stilgar with some subtle bits of humour. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is a terrifying psychopath you enjoy hating while he's on screen.

I may see this again soon, but what I really need is more. Hopefully we can get more ""Dune"" movies from the same team and cast in the coming years.",after credit began roll i sat absolut energ i watch dune part two easili one the best scifi movi st centuri deni villeneuv left bar high first dune thi movi easili cross bar put even higher it masterclass film make visual accoust experi leav delight core everi shot grand largerthanlif film make certainli show everi littl dime budget set design costum makeup effect work sound incred score han zimmer an epic piec cinema havent seen sinc lord ring movi year ago it wouldnt work though without fit cast timoth chalamet deliv presenc i didnt think possibl zendaya lot heavi lift javier bardem mix amaz role true believ stilgar subtl bit humour austin butler feydrautha terrifi psychopath enjoy hate he screen i may see soon i realli need hope get dune movi team cast come year

This work is treasure and we need to protect it. The amount of love put towards making this adaptation can be seen in this film. Amazing visuals, storytelling, acting, SOUND, score, cinematography and Rhythms. That thumper sound when it hits in IMAX is an experience I will never forget.

I wanted to scream and cheer and clap! Not to mention the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer is and will be known one of the greatest compositors of all times.

I cannot wait for part 3 as I was left with pain in my heart at the end of part 2.

I have to admit that I didn't trust Timothy's acting but I was so wrong. He really proved to really connect with his character. Everyone played beautifully.

"I think one word truly encapsulates the essence of this firm: MASTERPIECE. The first film in the series was undeniably good, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, this latest installment surpassed all expectations and can only be described as fantastic from start to finish. The experience of watching this film at an IMAX theater was a reminder of why IMAX theaters were created in the first place - the immersive visuals and sound truly enhanced the viewing experience.

Every actor in this film delivered an incredible performance, bringing their characters to life in a way that captivated and moved the audience. The chemistry between the cast members was palpable, adding depth and emotion to the already gripping storyline.

I am already looking forward to the release of this film on 4K Blu-ray, as it is a purchase I will definitely be making. The stunning visuals and expertly crafted cinematography deserve to be appreciated in the highest quality possible. For those who have the opportunity, I highly recommend seeing this film in IMAX - the impact and intensity of the experience are truly unforgettable.

In conclusion, this film is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. The combination of stellar performances, breathtaking visuals, Hans Zimmer's heart-pounding soundtrack, and a gripping storyline make it a must-see for any film enthusiast.

"No thrills for me, maybe except one scene in the entire movie. Ithought that by splitting it in two parts, it will be time for character development. It was time, but it looks like a rase to develop it.

There are characters that worth exploit more, like Irulan for example.

"The ideas behind Dune that drive the narrative are very complex. Denis Villeneuve has captured the essence of the Dune series in a way that presents it cohesively to a wider audience. This movie builds on the first in such magnitude and grandeur. The CGI is beautiful, you really feel the barrenness of the planet Arrakis, the bleak and sombre Giedi Prime caused by the black sun, it's all genius really.

The casting is superb, everyone brings their A-game, the standout for me was Austin Butler. Everytime he was on screen, I was outwardly cringing because I had no idea what his actions would be. The soundtrack is also epic, the music soars in the scenes of triumph, but also masterfully adds suspense.

I never read the original novel. I don't have any preconceived notions about what DUNE should be, but it does NOT deserve the lofty rating and ranking it has on IMDb.

"Dune, part two definitely is impressive visually with a great musical score. The sound effects alone are remarkable and very loud specially watching it at Dolby Theatre.

And that's about it, really! The overall plot was lacking big time, without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership, it's very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages, their rise to leadership and power. Unlike history however, the story buildup is weak, the script lacks originality and the whole ( he is the one ! ) scenario have been utilized so many times in films ( for eg, the Matrix ).

There are no high stakes, whether or not the protagonist is the One has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight it.

The movie still has some very solid moments, like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic. In fact, the scenes with Villains were more amusing than the protagonists.

Acting is decent but nothing spectacular, Zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why. She needs to train and work harder on her skills.

Timothee Chalamant, is slightly better, but not very impressive. Dave Bautista is under utilized and both his character and Chalamant's scream too much, it's distracting.

Speaking of loud, there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers ( i think they are called Fremen ), chanting words like Lasan Algaib and Modeb, these two words probably consumed half the script, repeated over and over, it is exhausting.

I know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages, but the frequent shifting between English and Fremen or whatever its called was another distraction.

Probably the chemistry between Zendaya and Chalamant are the worst I've ever seen, i am not sure if its their acting or the script, but it felt forced and predictable.

As mentioned earlier, musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie, superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it. Same with the visuals, the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of Dune, its such an experience! But after a while, one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high, which lacked.

I would probably say the costume design department is the best, definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters, could be nominated for best costume design.

Action scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as I mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing. Not to mention, battle scenes are brief and felt rushed. I was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences, something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes, specifically the final battle scene.

So yeah, it is ok with some memorable scenes, but left me generally disappointed and I think its over hyped, I do recall liking the first movie more. It could have at least be shorter than 2 hours 45 minutes or some better choreography and tension in battles scenes. A little less emphasis on the prophecy angle.",dune part two definit impress visual great music score the sound effect alon remark loud special watch dolbi theatr and that realli the overal plot lack big time without spoil anyth strongli base propheci leadership similar mani well known histor stori prophet messag rise leadership power unlik histori howev stori buildup weak script lack origin whole one scenario util mani time film eg matrix there high stake whether protagonist one major consequ least script fail highlight the movi still solid moment like introduct main villain black white scene fantast in fact scene villain amus protagonist act decent noth spectacular zendaya basic angri impress throughout without clear reason she need train work harder skill timothe chalam slightli better impress dave bautista util charact chalam scream much distract speak loud also plenti shout villag think call fremen chant word like lasan algaib modeb two word probabl consum half script repeat exhaust i know director want reflect authent languag frequent shift english fremen whatev call anoth distract probabl chemistri zendaya chalam worst ive ever seen sure act script felt forc predict a mention earlier music score sound effect highlight movi superb transfer film same visual color gradient atmospher suck world dune experi but one want stori arc keep one interest high lack i would probabl say costum design depart best definit impress style uniqu costum design almost charact could nomin best costum design action scene loud impress lack tension i mention high stake protagonist lose not mention battl scene brief felt rush i expect epic battl strategi action sequenc someth like star war lord ring emphasi focu battl scene specif final battl scene so yeah ok memor scene left gener disappoint i think hype i recal like first movi it could least shorter hour minut better choreographi tension battl scene a littl less emphasi propheci angl

"""Dune:Part Two"" is actually sci-fi at its finest. It has great world building, many world building lores, so many new rules and places to explore. The fundamental things that build this world have their counterparts in our own and that is what grounds this story and helps us find the allegory in it. Dennis Villeneuve has crafted a beautiful and awe-inspiring movie. There are some very beautiful and cinematic scenes, some epic scenes and so much craftsmanship in this movie. Chalamet proves that he is a real Hollywood protagonist, he can command an epic scale film. The entire cast is having fun with their parts, they are all very good at what their doing. This entire movie plays with the thematics of religion and Messiahs arriving to save the wretched. So many visual queues and so many powerful scenes enhance this way of viewing the movie. ""Dune: Part Two"" works for me wonderfully in the continuity of the lore from the first movie, but it sure has its own thematics. It is an epic scale sci-fi movie and a high fantasy world, but its strength lies in the ways everything relates to our world.

"Good god, this was incredibly boring! I wanted to turn it off several times but managed to convince myself that something of import will bring it all together at the end; I could not have been more wrong.

After watching the first one and not really understanding what was going on and why, I figured that it would come together in the second one, more fool me.

An impressive cast failed to bring any life to this whatsoever, alongside a dead plot and dialogue. And questions still abound as to what is going on, along with many glaring problems:

-With the Fremen coming across as a middle-eastern tribe in behaviour, it strikes me as all very ""White Saviour""- nobody has a problem with this?!

-Paul's mother suddenly becoming the Reverend Mother and inciting the Fremen to blindly follow him was highly disturbing, not inspiring. Plus the whole talking to her unborn daughter was creepy as!

-Paul leaps impossibly from a sincere boy not wanting to be a false leader to whatever that was he turned into at the end, which not only seemed unbelievable, but didn't remotely favour him in the viewer's eyes. I did not root for him at any point.

-The Fremen speak in their language but when they switch to English, lapse back into their real accents- where's the pretense that you're a tribesman? Same with Zendaya's behaviour, it's like it just completely falls away from her once they become a couple.

-Completely non-existent chemistry between Zendaya and Timothy Chalamet. They go from wary friends to full on couple with no idea how they got there.

-It's revealed that Paul's mother is a Harkonen, which makes him so too, so what? What is the significance of this? Yeah I know they're fighting one another but why the hell should I really care?! Means nothing to me.

-Why does Paul suddenly want to be Emperor at the end? Why does he betray Chani? It's so inconsistent with how his character was portrayed for most of it.

-That battle and one-to-one fight at the end was the ultimate anti-climax.

-We find out that the witch clan moved the Emperor to exterminate House Atreides, I still don't know why? Unless there was some form of explanation that clearly didn't do its job.

"Dune has got to be one of the hardest books to translate into a film. So much of the writing comes from within each characters head.

Watching Denis Villeneuve take every important detail and bring it to life was nothing short of pure wonder. You can really tell that Dune was one of his favourite stories. His visual direction, the breathtaking audio, the beautiful sets, and the top-tier acting are all big elements in the overall production... but sometimes there's there's something else beyond that. The passion that really shines through.

One of the best movies ever made. Period. Kudos to everyone involved in every aspect of the production. And a huge thank you to the studio for allowing these people to perform their craft to the best of their abilities.",dune got one hardest book translat film so much write come within charact head watch deni villeneuv take everi import detail bring life noth short pure wonder you realli tell dune one favourit stori hi visual direct breathtak audio beauti set toptier act big element overal product sometim there there someth el beyond the passion realli shine one best movi ever made period kudo everyon involv everi aspect product and huge thank studio allow peopl perform craft best abil
"I've never taken the time to write any reviews here before, and i'll remain short on my words with this one.

I am a hardcore Dune fan. Read the 6 core books, re-listened to them multiple times on Audible. Played the games, as far back as the RTS games of the early 2000s. Watched the Lynch film and the SyFy TV series several times.

This is another level. This IS Dune. I saw the Dune Part 1 in cinemas 7 times, and will likely do the same with Part 2. The cinema experience is worth it for the sound design alone. Unlike Part 1, the voices were clearer and sat better in the mix in Part 2.

"What an epic. Textbook perfect of how a modern day sci-fi should be made. Every scene feels impactful and is a work of art. The politics, character development and cinematography all goes beyond what you expect from a science fiction film, and shows the path of how movies like Star Wars ought to be. Timothee and Zendaya's performance are also top notch. While the first film was a work of art, the second film is the real progression and heart of the film and deserves to be watched in IMAX or better only. The only gripe I have is there are a couple scenes where I am confused by Paul's motivation and his sudden change of heart, I felt that needed further explaining.",what epic textbook perfect modern day scifi made everi scene feel impact work art the polit charact develop cinematographi goe beyond expect scienc fiction film show path movi like star war ought timothe zendaya perform also top notch while first film work art second film real progress heart film deserv watch imax better the gripe i coupl scene i confus paul motiv sudden chang heart i felt need explain
"Stay with me here.

It's basically a re-make of 'The Life of Brian' with Paul as Brian and Chani as Brian's mother (""he's not the messiah, he's a really naughty boy"").

At it's heart the book is about not believing in messianic leaders. I think Villeneuve has done an incredible job of what was believed to be a book that was impossible to be translated into film.

At it's heart he uses the Chani character to seed doubt of Paul's godlike leadership.

Needs to be seen in a cinema. Some scenes took my breath away.

Left me wanting more.

Timothee Chalamet owns his role as Paul Atreides and is very convincing. Powerful performance. The same goes for Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, and everyone is just AMAZING! I did find Christopher Walken to be a bit miscast but he grew on me.

"""Dune 2,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, is a cinematic marvel that transcends expectations. Villeneuve's visionary direction brings Frank Herbert's universe to life with stunning cinematography that mesmerizes viewers. Each frame is meticulously crafted, capturing the grandeur of the desert landscapes and the intricacies of the characters' emotions.

Hans Zimmer's evocative score adds depth to every scene, immersing audiences in a world of tension and reflection. The performances, particularly by Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, are captivating, drawing viewers into the characters' inner struggles.

The film's visual mastery is matched only by its gripping narrative. Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica is particularly noteworthy, adding layers of complexity to the story. The dialogue, sharp and profound, elevates the film to a new standard of excellence.

In summary, ""Dune 2"" is a triumph of cinema, combining breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and outstanding performances. Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as a master filmmaker, delivering a cinematic experience that is both thought-provoking and visually stunning.",dune direct deni villeneuv cinemat marvel transcend expect villeneuv visionari direct bring frank herbert univers life stun cinematographi mesmer viewer each frame meticul craft captur grandeur desert landscap intricaci charact emot han zimmer evoc score add depth everi scene immers audienc world tension reflect the perform particularli timoth chalamet zendaya captiv draw viewer charact inner struggl the film visual masteri match grip narr rebecca ferguson portray ladi jessica particularli noteworthi ad layer complex stori the dialogu sharp profound elev film new standard excel in summari dune triumph cinema combin breathtak visual compel storytel outstand perform deni villeneuv proven master filmmak deliv cinemat experi thoughtprovok visual stun
"""I want to start by saying the movie did not suck! However, the dialogue was a bit confusing, and the accents were difficult to understand at times. That's a minor point, though, and not the basis of my rating. The middle part of the movie felt dry, much like the desert where it was filmed. It was too long and drawn out. I understand that character development is necessary, but as a sci-fi film, it could have benefited from more action and a better showcase of the technology they used. . Some of the technology we see is very interesting, and I would have loved to see more of it. When I left the theater, I felt that the movie missed the mark on some storytelling elements.

"As of my last update in January 2022, ""Dune: Part Two"" had not been released, so I cannot provide specific details about the film. However, I can offer a speculative description based on what is known about the ""Dune"" universe and the potential direction of the sequel.

""Dune: Part Two"" is expected to be the continuation of the epic science fiction saga based on the second half of Frank Herbert's seminal novel ""Dune."" Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the sequel is anticipated to delve deeper into the intricate political intrigue, complex characters, and richly detailed world of Arrakis.

The story is likely to follow the journey of Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) as he embraces his destiny as the messianic figure known as Muad'Dib, leading the Fremen in a rebellion against the oppressive rule of House Harkonnen and the galactic Emperor. As Paul's powers as a Bene Gesserit-trained warrior and prescient visionary grow, he faces internal conflicts and external threats, including the ominous forces of the malevolent entity known as the Bene Tleilax.

The film is expected to further explore the themes of power, religion, ecology, and the human condition that are central to the ""Dune"" universe. It will likely feature breathtaking visuals, intricate world-building, and intense character dynamics, characteristic of Villeneuve's directorial style.

With an ensemble cast including Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and others reprising their roles, ""Dune: Part Two"" promises to be an epic continuation of the saga that captivated audiences with its first installment. Fans can anticipate a cinematic experience that combines spectacle with substance, as the story of ""Dune"" unfolds across the sands of Arrakis and beyond.",a last updat januari dune part two releas i cannot provid specif detail film howev i offer specul descript base known dune univers potenti direct sequel dune part two expect continu epic scienc fiction saga base second half frank herbert semin novel dune direct deni villeneuv sequel anticip delv deeper intric polit intrigu complex charact richli detail world arraki the stori like follow journey paul atreid play timoth chalamet embrac destini messian figur known muaddib lead fremen rebellion oppress rule hous harkonnen galact emperor a paul power bene gesserittrain warrior prescient visionari grow face intern conflict extern threat includ omin forc malevol entiti known bene tleilax the film expect explor theme power religion ecolog human condit central dune univers it like featur breathtak visual intric worldbuild intens charact dynam characterist villeneuv directori style with ensembl cast includ rebecca ferguson oscar isaac zendaya josh brolin other repris role dune part two promis epic continu saga captiv audienc first instal fan anticip cinemat experi combin spectacl substanc stori dune unfold across sand arraki beyond
"I doubt anyone will read this, but I have never written a review on a movie before. Though I watch many movies, I have never actually written a review for any of them. This is a testament to how beautiful this movie is. There is so much that I want to write. All I can recommend is that you watch/rewatch the first movie with subtitles on and just soak in all of the information given to you. Then, watch Dune. Part Two and be in the moment. It contains politics and amazing choreography. There were many times, in fact, that I stood in the theater out of sheer amazement (No, there wasn't anyone sitting behind me.)

This movie is amazing. I cannot stop thinking about it. A masterclass in sci-fi.

This is Epic cinema at its best , the cinematography, the story, the character development, the action ... The action is just on its own level , so raw, swift and well done , if you blink you will miss it at the pace that it's happening. No slo mo rubbish needed.

The world building in the first one was what I found most intriguing and I'm happy to report that it is just as good in part 2. To top it all off , Hans Zimmer has created a score so iconic for this film again . His music makes the film come alive and stay in your head well after you have left the cinema.

"Denise Villeneuve is a genius. Him and Greige Fraser have done it again and even better than 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' is an amazing sequel to the first one, every single second of the 3 hours are worth the time and effort that has gone into this movie.

The visual effects that were created are mind-blowing, even in the very first scene.

The costume designs are truly incredible, the amount of detail that can be seen in just one costume is out of this world. Every costume shows the ancient history which comes with the planet and characters.

Set design was also outstanding. Every set has its own aura to it, the sets in the desert have carvings all over the walls which show how old the planet is, and all the history it has experienced.

Hans Zimmer created a perfect score to the movie. A lot of ancient instruments are used (The Duduk, Zurnka etc.) and these instruments are made of wood and as the music of these instruments play a sense of history and the heavy future and past is felt just through music notes. It brings chills just listening to the score.

Denise Villeneuve's world building in this movie is right out of the books. Sitting in the theatre you experience the movie because of the scale which is shown. The planet is breathtaking, the space-ships are futuristic, the sandworms are felt as if infront of you. It's truly incredible!

The casting choices are perfect! The old cast (Timothée Chalamet, Zendeya, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson etc.) are amazing and kept their characters epic. But the new cast adds something to the movie. Most surprising character was Feyd-Rautha and the way Austin Butler portrayed the psychotic beast that is described in the books, and he brought it to screen. It was so incredible seeing him take on this psycho role, especially after Elvis. Personally Stilgar and Feyd-Rautha might be my favourite characters in this sequel. Javier Bardem does an amazing job playing Stilgar seriously yet managing to sneak in a bit of comedy.

Timothee Chalamet delivers a speach in Chakobsa (Fremen language) which is so powerful! It's so incredible seeing how the change of language can influence a scene. This specific scene truly shows how talanted Timothée Chalamet is.

I really recommend watching this movie in IMAX since it was filmed specifically for IMAX. And if you've not read the books then it's a must and if you have read the book it's such a pleasure to watch the book come to life with the way Denise Villeneuve filmed this.

This is the best Dune movie out there! Truly Epic!

"By no means a masterpiece, standards for film just seem to be lower these days. Lots of problems, the characters jump from location to location and there is a lot of filling in the gaps, it is by no means a fluid film. The dialogue is fairly mediocre at times, the score is good but not masterful. A rather annoying proliferation of American accents pervade the film as well and really take one out of the universe, particularly from Zendaya. Overall a good film and an achievement for all those involved but this story (the hero's journey) has been told much better than what we see here with Dune.

It is not all negative though, some very nice cinematography. Good performances from the lead and Havier Bardem providing some much needed comic relief as well.",by mean masterpiec standard film seem lower day lot problem charact jump locat locat lot fill gap mean fluid film the dialogu fairli mediocr time score good master a rather annoy prolifer american accent pervad film well realli take one univers particularli zendaya overal good film achiev involv stori hero journey told much better see dune it neg though nice cinematographi good perform lead havier bardem provid much need comic relief well

But now I saw the second movie from Dune. Damn that got me shivers all of my body. The music from Hans Zimmer is out of this world (good because it doesn't take place on this one!). The actors are great! And I believed every single part of it. It was surprising, different and beautiful.

There was love, believe, hope and everything you want from a blockbuster. A blockbuster with a great storyline. The director did a awesome job with making this movie so much different than everything you have ever seen before.

However, this second part takes it to another level and delivers one of the best films I've ever seen. This is real cinema. How can I go back to superhero movies after an experience like this? I feel like we've been so deprived of this quality for years.

The acting is top-tier and Timothee Chalamet does an excellent job (as does the whole cast). The costumes are beautiful, the cinematography is breath-taking, the themes are rich and complex. I could go on!

"I believe that part 2 surpasses part 1 in terms of beauty, even though part 1 was already quite stunning. In part 2, the divergence from the books is more pronounced for obvious sequel reasons, which led to choices different from what I would have preferred (no spoilers here).

Due to these editorial decisions, some iconic quotes from the original material are missing in this adaptation (like ""My brother is coming"").

Despite the teasing for the sequel, I still find Lynch's or the HBO miniseries' versions more compelling in terms of storytelling. However, nothing can compare to the visual and auditory spectacle that Dune parts 1 and 2 present.

Lynch's adaptation took liberties, such as introducing the sound weapon, but it maintained a closer adherence to the overall storyline and atmosphere of the books. Perhaps my nostalgia plays a role here, as I first experienced it in the theatre upon its release.

Some scenes require a certain level of visceral (yet functional) gore to remain faithful to the story, and Villeneuve's version seems to lack that element.",i believ part surpass part term beauti even though part alreadi quit stun in part diverg book pronounc obviou sequel reason led choic differ i would prefer spoiler due editori decis icon quot origin materi miss adapt like my brother come despit tea sequel i still find lynch hbo miniseri version compel term storytel howev noth compar visual auditori spectacl dune part present lynch adapt took liberti introduc sound weapon maintain closer adher overal storylin atmospher book perhap nostalgia play role i first experienc theatr upon releas some scene requir certain level viscer yet function gore remain faith stori villeneuv version seem lack element

I'm sorry but she is not a good actress. There was too much riding on her acting skills and she just couldn't do it. They could have gone with so many other actresses but they didn't. Whenever she was on the screen, I just wanted her to go away. She isn't likable. She only has one tone to her acting. She just seems annoyed. I think that's why I liked the first one more.

"It's hard to escape the ellipse of the source material, to the point where I feel like it's impossible to adapt the original epic saga written by Frank Herbert into the structure of a movie.

I used the knowledge from the books to just fill in the gaps and wasn't too upset with what was left out or abridged. I've enjoyed soaking in the visuals and with how they depicted the world. It is beyond what I could imagine from simply reading the books.

However, I don't know if those same visuals would make any sense to people who either haven't read the books. The actors themselves had to do a lot of the heavy lifting to perform most of it instead of telling the audience out right what is happening, which might easily be misconstrued.

There's also so much happening even in the film that I fear audience members can't retain it all within a single viewing. Such as one of the early comment questions was 'why weren't the personal shields used out in the desert', which was explained outright in the first film. In part two, audience would either need to have remembered, or infer the reason why.

With how the first two films went, I'm a bit afraid of how part 3 might even be more condensed. Even with the star-studded cast, I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to the average audience member to watch.

I still say it's better than David Lynch's Dune though, with how Denis Villeneuve, the director, chose to play out a lot of the scenes.",it hard escap ellips sourc materi point i feel like imposs adapt origin epic saga written frank herbert structur movi i use knowledg book fill gap wasnt upset left abridg ive enjoy soak visual depict world it beyond i could imagin simpli read book howev i dont know visual would make sen peopl either havent read book the actor lot heavi lift perform instead tell audienc right happen might easili misconstru there also much happen even film i fear audienc member cant retain within singl view such one earli comment question werent person shield use desert explain outright first film in part two audienc would either need rememb infer reason with first two film went im bit afraid part might even condens even starstud cast i probabl wouldnt recommend movi averag audienc member watch i still say better david lynch dune though deni villeneuv director chose play lot scene
"What a strange pacing, the movie felt rush despite being 2h45.

Many scenes are reminiscent of the first feature without adding anything to the story and/or the development of the characters arcs.

The visuals are great, but it doesn't makes it for everything unfortunately, its structure has the same borrowing feeling of Campbell's hero's journey from Star Wars : A New Hope, being also +40 years late. (Despite having a better source material from the book, unfortunately not used that much efficiently)

The sides are defined with a manichean style, the antagonists don't have any substance unfortunately, House Harkonnen is full of bad guys, the whole arc introducing Feyd-Rautha is honestly anecdotal.

The movie also clearly lacks of stakes, due to a confusing editing style where the epic scenes are rushed down, making you feel like all the meaningful deaths were used in the first entrance, giving absolutely 0 thrilling moments despite once again, a truly achievement in terms of visuals and sound design, the two value added seeing it in theaters imo.

Overral its hard to recommend a movie being so safe and dull, participating to the slowly decay of an industry that struggle to reinventing itself, counting only on franchising and uniforming formulas of mythical stories.

"The best film of the past four years. The film is inspired by the history of European wars and is also greatly inspired by the emergence of the dawn of Islam, but it certainly presents it from an atheistic point of view, because the writer of the novel sees the Mahdi as a dangerous person, more dangerous even than the empire, and even sees religions as something superstitious, and that view will be annoying for Christians, and of course especially Muslims, but as a Muslim I was not bothered because I understand the extent of Western writers' ignorance of the history of the Abrahamic religions and see them as religions that prevent human freedom, while in fact they ignore the history of the world before the emergence of the Abrahamic religions.

Actually, WW1 and 2 were made by atheists, and even the nuclear bomb was made by atheists Hitler himself is atheist, and you can't mix with what happened to Native Americans by Christians with the Islamic Empire because Muslims during centuries visited a lot of territories in Europe and east Asia, and even they reached Australia, but they didn't make any holy war against those people. The novel and movie will provide a collective view of what happened with crusaders and the Spanish, British, and French at the dawn of Islam.

The film was also much better than the first part, and even the soundtrack was better than the first part. The music by Hans Zimmer is his best since the music for Interstellar, and Greig Fraser's cinematography is also the best in his entire career. The film is very impressive, but Prisoners remains the best film by director Denis Villeneuve.",the best film past four year the film inspir histori european war also greatli inspir emerg dawn islam certainli present atheist point view writer novel see mahdi danger person danger even empir even see religion someth superstiti view annoy christian cours especi muslim muslim i bother i understand extent western writer ignor histori abraham religion see religion prevent human freedom fact ignor histori world emerg abraham religion actual ww made atheist even nuclear bomb made atheist hitler atheist cant mix happen nativ american christian islam empir muslim centuri visit lot territori europ east asia even reach australia didnt make holi war peopl the novel movi provid collect view happen crusad spanish british french dawn islam the film also much better first part even soundtrack better first part the music han zimmer best sinc music interstellar greig fraser cinematographi also best entir career the film impress prison remain best film director deni villeneuv

"""Dune 2"" presents a challenge, not for a lack of things to say, but rather because of the abundance of remarkable elements worthy of discussion.

At the forefront, the acting in this sequel is nothing short of superb, demonstrating a deep understanding of the complex characters and the dense world they inhabit. Visually, the film transcends expectations; its use of color and composition is not merely beautiful but borders on genius, creating a vivid, immersive experience that enhances the narrative's emotional and thematic depth.

However, despite these strengths, I find myself hesitating to award ""Dune 2"" a perfect score, a reservation I also held for Dune 1. The films' inability to stand entirely independent of one another, just throws me off. The anticipation for subsequent chapters is palpable throughout, leading to a sense of incompleteness. While anticipation can be a strength, in this instance, it borders on leaving the viewer in a constant state of waiting. This is a film, not a TV show.

Yet, it's impossible to overlook the brilliance with which ""Dune 2"" explores the intricacies of human nature, intertwining it with elements of fantasy and what can only be described as 'scientific magic.' This blend feels like a not-very-far future that I will not be alive to see.

The music, in concert with the film's visual and thematic elements, elevates the narrative, crafting an immersive experience that is both profound and emotionally resonant.

"When you talk about a modern day classic, look no further! Absolutely fantastic. Denis Villeneuve has to be the absolute best director out right now, the man doesn't miss. Every film I seen by him I love.

All star performances by everyone. The best performances I've ever seen from Timothee Chalet. The range this dude can hit while acting is up there with all the greats. Zendaya was also really good in this too and by far her best performance I've ever seen her in. Also can't forget Austin Butler! This dude was menacing and a standout in this movie.

You HAVE to experience this on the big screen in IMAX! Breathe-taking to look at and experience.

My only negative is that, man, I wish this was rated R.

"And the power of a brilliant second part is the power to create the best trilogy ever. This film surprised me in ways I didn't think were possible after the first one.

The sound design really stands out and creates with the ever-brilliant music of Hans Zimmer the best audio atmosphere I ever experienced. The stunning landscapes and the visually beautiful effects even got better than the first film which many critics also highly praised back then for the effects. Top-notch visuals also in all the fighting scenes, being it explosions or hand-to-hand combat.

The way the story is presented felt a bit unusual but the more I think about it, I think that it is the right way to make the film appear as boring. You have to carefully watch and listen to every dialogue or even every line. Otherwise you can miss important information and can become a bit confused later. Lots of deep dives into Fremmen culture and believes. For this reason I highly recommend to watch the first film shortly before.

The cast that presents this story part is brilliantly chosen and each and everyone delivers. Timothée Chalamet and Javier Bardem stood out which harmonizes very well with the development of their respective characters.

Can't say how amazed I was by every aspect of this film. Maybe the best sci-fi film in the last decade and if Messiah (Part 3) is just as good as this we have the best trilogy ever created in film history.",and power brilliant second part power creat best trilog ever thi film surpris way i didnt think possibl first one the sound design realli stand creat everbrilli music han zimmer best audio atmospher i ever experienc the stun landscap visual beauti effect even got better first film mani critic also highli prais back effect topnotch visual also fight scene explos handtohand combat the way stori present felt bit unusu i think i think right way make film appear bore you care watch listen everi dialogu even everi line otherwis miss import inform becom bit confus later lot deep dive fremmen cultur believ for reason i highli recommend watch first film shortli the cast present stori part brilliantli chosen everyon deliv timoth chalamet javier bardem stood harmon well develop respect charact cant say amaz i everi aspect film mayb best scifi film last decad messiah part good best trilog ever creat film histori
"I have to start this review by asking what are people rating this movie 10/10 eating because it's one really potent hallucinogen, because this movie ain't a ten.

That said, it's visually very striking and pretty to look at. Music definitely overstays its welcome as every other shot is ""braaaam"" followed by some epic sounding tune and this gets old within first 10 minutes, of a 2h+ movie.

As for acting. It was solid all around. I expected Paul to be more jarring but to my surprise he didn't stand out at all. Which is a good and a bad thing at the same time.

Overall it's an entertaining movie which I'd rate 7.5, but I have to pick whole number so 7 it is. Ending is really disappointing and different from Lynch's Dune which I still prefer today.",i start review ask peopl rate movi eat one realli potent hallucinogen movi aint ten that said visual strike pretti look music definit overstay welcom everi shot braaaam follow epic sound tune get old within first minut h movi a act it solid around i expect paul jar surpris didnt stand which good bad thing time overal entertain movi id rate i pick whole number end realli disappoint differ lynch dune i still prefer today
"Once again the idiots at hollywood decided to screw up another brilliant source material, for no apprent reason.

The only people loving this joke are the onces who have never read the original book.

If Villeneuve wanted to change things so much, he should write his own bad stories like Synder.

The supposed lovers have no chemistry zero, zilch. The character of Chani, so beautiful in the book has been butchered by a wooden faced actor only scowls through the entire movie. The mother seems to be pregnant for like years, I mean it's mother of all pregnancies.. With no end in sight. Lol 😂 The powerful spacing guild is totally missing, so are the bene gesserit. And who killed the baron, really...

Compared to this abomination, even the 1984 Lynch version, though it too was flawed, can still be considered far superior and Oscar worthy.

Personally, I will continue to stick with SyFy channel's 2000 version of Dune, which too did take some liberties, but stayed much closer and true to the original story.

If you really want to enjoy the world of Dune, just read the book. No film will be able to do justice to it's epic span, characters, politics and religion and story telling, specially something coming from hollywood.",onc idiot hollywood decid screw anoth brilliant sourc materi apprent reason the peopl love joke onc never read origin book if villeneuv want chang thing much write bad stori like synder the suppos lover chemistri zero zilch the charact chani beauti book butcher wooden face actor scowl entir movi the mother seem pregnant like year i mean mother pregnanc with end sight lol the power space guild total miss bene gesserit and kill baron realli compar abomin even lynch version though flaw still consid far superior oscar worthi person i continu stick syfi channel version dune take liberti stay much closer true origin stori if realli want enjoy world dune read book no film abl justic epic span charact polit religion stori tell special someth come hollywood
"Part Two is a visually stunning and epic film that is sure to please fans of the first film and newcomers alike. The film is a faithful adaptation of the second half of Frank Herbert's novel, and it captures the scope and scale of the story in a way that few films have ever been able to do.

The film is set in the far future, on the desert planet Arrakis. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), is the rightful heir to the planet, but he has been forced to flee into the desert after his family is betrayed. In the desert, Paul meets the Fremen, a group of people who have adapted to living on Arrakis. The Fremen believe that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic figure who will lead them to freedom.

Paul must embrace his destiny and lead the Fremen in a war against the Harkonnens, the evil family that has taken control of Arrakis. The film is full of action, adventure, and political intrigue. It is a story about good versus evil, and it explores themes of destiny, hope, and betrayal.

The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who also directed the first film. Villeneuve does an excellent job of bringing Herbert's novel to life. He creates a visually stunning world that is both beautiful and dangerous. The film is also well-acted, with Chalamet giving a standout performance as Paul Atreides.

The first movie was good to very good, this is better, all the way.

Fans of the book will be extremely happy with the adaptation.

The world building involved and sense of scale used by Denis in the movie is the work of a master. The nearest analogue that sprang to mind was The Return of the King, final instalment of the Lord of the rings trilogy.

While excluding some of the material from the books is necessary in order obtain a reasonable movie length, I believe altering the personality of the characters is a dangerous play and this time it didn't pay off imo.

"This movie epitomizes the 2020s not just in film but in western society.

It is visually far superior to its predecessor, but lacks anything spiritual. All glitz and pretty faces and few true acting gems. If you want to see what Bardem and Brolin can actually do, watch ""No Country for Old Men"". Reminds me of the song Baker's Street by Gerry Rafferty. ""It's got so many people, but it's got no soul.""

If you want to be visually dazzled and brain numbed, this is the movie for you. If you have a short attention span, this is for you. If you wish to be emotionally or intellectually challenged, you must view any of Villeneuve's other films.

"When Dune (Part One) released in 2021, Dune: Part Two hadn't been greenlit yet and wasn't guaranteed to happen. Then we rejoiced when it was, and waited eagerly for the second half of the epic story. And after all that time, plus an extra four months resulting from the writers' and actors' strikes, it's finally here. And it was worth waiting every second for.

Dune: Part Two is a staggering achievement. Villeneuve's direction on point as always, but his visionary realisation of the books is remarkable. From huge brutalist architecture to seas of desert sand, all beautifully shot by Greig Frasier at the top of his game. Particularly, shooting the monochrome sequence in infrared was a genius move and creates a deeply unsettling atmosphere for introducing Austin Butler's antagonist.

Speaking of, the entire cast are in flying form, both new additions and returning favourites. Chalamet's descent from the calm and reserved Paul to the erratic warlord is a remarkable performance, as is the sinister turn from Rebecca Ferguson. Fellow showstoppers include the aforementioned terrifying Butler, the devout extremist from Javier Bardem and Zendaya's uncertainty with her place in the future.

Being essentially the second and third acts of the novel, Part Two is naturally more action oriented than the first entry. In that regard they feel very different to each other, but both feel equally necessary in their respective executions. Part One's meticulous world-building and character set-up is expertly paid off throughout Part Two and feels intensely rewarding. Parallels to Lawrence of Arabia can be seen everywhere from both a story perspective and in the epic scale of the desert, but this is one of the very few films to achieve that same level of awe and wonder at every step of the journey.

A cinematic phenomenon in every sense of the word. A cautionary tale on idolisation. The corruption of morality in the face of absolute power. The escalation of warfare fueled by cultural belief. The betrayal of heritage in forging a new path.

The false prophet playing God.

See it.

"Does the dictionary have enough adjective to describe what I have witnessed at the 70mm IMAX theater today, an epic, extraordinary, breathtaking experience which I recommend all movies' lover to experience.

Every aspect of this movie was well executed, the complexity of the story was geniuously explained as long as the movie runs,in addition the scenario was not boring or expected as long as the new events were smoothly presented.

We should grandly salute the work of actors, the cast was brilliant and each one of them contributed with his unique presence, also a confession that Timothée Chalamet was astonishing, is a must, his character development was so strong that if he asked the audience to fight for him they will do.

The politics were strongly presented, it can be easily related in what is happening now in the middle east, also the movie shows how power can be acquired with different methods and possibilities, depanding on circumstances.

Furthermore, I don't think that I have enough words to describe the world that was built by Denis Villeneuve neither the cinematography by Greig Fraser nor the score by Hanz Zimmer, this trio made sure that we have a master piece in which audience and movie characters were all in one unit.

"This will be a memorable film for at least the next 20 years, the size, the costumes, the world building, its everything I wanted to see!

I have to mention that the film does feel very rushed sometimes but that's to be expected based on what I heard about the books, the amount of scheming and overall magnitute of everything.

I loved the way it looked, everything is Human but also Alien, as you would expect from a timeline (Or possible future!) where we don't use AI but our minds.

"Just a heads up: in this review I reference 80s Dune, Dune 1, Dune 2 and the book. I find it impossible not to!

Ok, so I saw the David Lynch version in the 80s and was completely transfixed by the opening sequence: The monologue by Princess Irulan, the secret report within the Guild and then the Guilds visit to the emperor; all perfectly timed and setting the scene and the feel for the rest of the film. All the characters are believable and (reasonably) well developed - at least as well as they can be in a single film.

Ok...I like the Villeneuve versions, really, I do - cinematically amazing, good soundtrack etc but ......but I really struggled to identify with the characters. I've read the book as well as seen the 80s version, and, unlike Villeneuve's version, Gurney, Duncan and Thufir actually do have personalities. For some reason, Villeneuve seems intent not to allow the actors to be or show closeness to one another - which would have MASSIVELY helped their character development. The whole reason for the Atredes family's success is because they ARE close to one another, and to those close to them such as Duncan and Gurney. Perhaps not so much Thufir.... But then again he IS a mentat so that would make sense. But in Villeneuve's, the relationship between Paul and Duncan does not feel visceral at all. In the Lynch version, you almost feel as though Paul loves Duncan like a father or an uncle.

Visceral is a word that many have used to describe this film but unfortunately I feel that the human connections in this film are sorely lacking in any viscerality; they just feel sterile. Even Walkin doesn't feel like an Emperor....he feels like....well ......he feels like....a BRO ...(Facepalm).... I mean...he supposed to be the Emperor of the known universe!

Is the Villeneuve version trying TOO hard to be cold and hard and loveless? Would it not have benefitted from showing more human closeness, which would've then heightened the sense of loss when House Atredes fell?

Moving on.... The Harkonnens.....mmmmm Can we be honest here...The Baron.... just....looks .... completely......ridiculous.

Like a hybrid of jabba the hutt and The Boss from one of those arcade games.

When he rises up and the soundtrack goes all weeereaaaawwwwnnnnoooo are we supposed to be impressed? Intimidated? I mean he just looks silly.

Raban at least looks brutal, violent and intimidating - which is what a Harkonnen is supposed to be!

Feyd just looks too soft for a Harkonnen. No amount of clothing or monochromatic style can change that.

The Jamis fight in 1 is outstanding, the Paul/Rauther fight in 2 is a fking car crash.

In Dune 1 Stilgar/Havier Bardem was absolutely on point in all aspects, but in 2 he turns into a gibbering idiot, his self assuredness evaporates and despite believing in Paul, he is still a leader amongst his people, and should behave as such.

In summation, every single aspect of this film is too ""monochrome"".

Another unfortunate example of a lot of money spent on a project that falls short.

"""Dune Part 2"" is not merely a continuation of its predecessor; it's an evolution, transcending the already high bar set by the first film to deliver a narrative and visual feast that solidifies its place in the pantheon of sci-fi/fantasy cinema. The film follows Paul Atreides on a complex journey of revenge and destiny, beautifully weaving together themes of love, power, and fate against the backdrop of the vast and treacherous universe that Frank Herbert created.

Denis Villeneuve's direction is nothing short of masterful, proving once again his unparalleled ability to bring to life the grandeur and intricacy of the Dune saga. The storytelling is rich and layered, providing depth to characters old and new, and immersing the audience in a world that is both alien and intimately familiar.

The technical achievements of ""Dune Part 2"" are staggering. Hans Zimmer's score is a powerful force, enhancing the narrative and elevating the emotional weight of each scene. The visual effects, production design, sound, and editing are executed with precision and artistry, creating a cinematic experience that is overwhelming in the best possible way.

What sets ""Dune Part 2"" apart, however, is its heart. The performances, particularly from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, are deeply moving, offering a window into the souls of their characters that is both revealing and compelling. The film masterfully balances epic action sequences with moments of profound intimacy, ensuring that the human element remains at the forefront of this vast cosmic tale.

In essence, ""Dune Part 2"" is a testament to the power of storytelling and the limitless possibilities of cinema. It expands upon the universe introduced in the first film, deepening our understanding and connection to the world and its inhabitants. The film manages to be both a monumental achievement in film-making and a deeply personal journey of love, loss, and redemption.

Seeing ""Dune Part 2"" in IMAX is highly recommended, as the scale and beauty of the film are truly meant to be experienced on the largest screen possible. This film is not just a sequel; it's an event-a cinematic landmark that will be remembered and celebrated for years to come.

As the credits rolled, I was left with a profound sense of awe and anticipation for what the future holds for the Dune saga. ""Dune Part 2"" is a masterpiece that not only meets but surpasses expectations, setting a new standard for what is possible in the realm of science fiction and fantasy filmmaking. It is, without a doubt, a classic in the making, and a shining example of how to beautifully blend the epic with the intimate.",dune part mere continu predecessor evolut transcend alreadi high bar set first film deliv narr visual feast solidifi place pantheon scififantasi cinema the film follow paul atreid complex journey reveng destini beauti weav togeth theme love power fate backdrop vast treacher univers frank herbert creat deni villeneuv direct noth short master prove unparallel abil bring life grandeur intricaci dune saga the storytel rich layer provid depth charact old new immers audienc world alien intim familiar the technic achiev dune part stagger han zimmer score power forc enhanc narr elev emot weight scene the visual effect product design sound edit execut precis artistri creat cinemat experi overwhelm best possibl way what set dune part apart howev heart the perform particularli timoth chalamet zendaya deepli move offer window soul charact reveal compel the film master balanc epic action sequenc moment profound intimaci ensur human element remain forefront vast cosmic tale in essenc dune part testament power storytel limitless possibl cinema it expand upon univers introduc first film deepen understand connect world inhabit the film manag monument achiev filmmak deepli person journey love loss redempt see dune part imax highli recommend scale beauti film truli meant experienc largest screen possibl thi film sequel eventa cinemat landmark rememb celebr year come a credit roll i left profound sen awe anticip futur hold dune saga dune part masterpiec meet surpass expect set new standard possibl realm scienc fiction fantasi filmmak it without doubt classic make shine exampl beauti blend epic intim
"The movie tries way way way too hard to take itself seriously but fails spectacularly and it is rather cringe, ridiculous and barely watchable.

I fail to understand where the top votes come from but I wouldn't be surprised if the movie maker's bots had something to say.

We were less than 15 people in the theater. 4 friends in total, 1 did what was said in the title, while one other was in and out sleeping. Last one said he would have rather watched paint dry. And we definitely don't have the same tastes in movies.

But for this movie we all came together to common ground.

I would cast Timothée Chalamet for a Twilight spin-off at most. Probably the most overrated actor these days.

OMG and Batista's character is so ridiculous. What was he in the movie? An eunuc? I don't think it's his acting, it's just poor casting. He was great in Guardians of the Galaxy.

I haven't read the books but I am positive it's millennia's better than the movie which was ruined by Hollywood stereotypical dialogue, ""there's no chance he can do that"" remarks from the characters and he does just that, and more.

Watch the first 30 minutes of the movie and write down everything they say it's impossible, difficult or rather not do. They will do it by the end. The End. Saved 2h of your life.

Oh, and the names... I bet they sound great in your head when you read the books, but listening to them whimpering OVER AND OVER AGAIN: Muad'Dib, na-Baron Feyd-Rautha and other is so criiiiiiinge. Some books deserve to remain books, not movie adaptations.

Waiting to hear about Dune Part 2 taking 1 million Oscars at that outdated, useless event.

"This film is the epitome of the sci-fi genre. The photography, the screenplay and the cast really make a difference, this is what hollywood should celebrate and be proud of. Really well executed, it stands out from all the other films, I really hope this franchise continues to elaborate the next movies with the same artistry and complexity than this one.

The acting is amazing, you can tell that every character in the film has been very careful with their performance, you really believe their words and the facial expressions.

"I've watched this movie with my mouth widen open. This movie is truly a masterpiece. Please if you can, watch it in IMAX. You will regret it so much if you don't. I haven't witnessed such a great movie in years.

First of al, Timothee Chalamet has shown to be one of the greatest actors of his generation. The character development throughout this movie is insane. From a kid that has a lot to learn. To one of the coolest characters ever.

The story is off course really old. But it feels so fresh and new. The movie is 3 hours long, but it feels fast and so enjoyable to watch. Also, the music is so wonderful done. So much emotion within the music and sounds.

There is so much to tell about this movie. But it's hard to do without spoiling it. You just HAVE to watch it on the big screens.

"While I enjoyed the first Dune very much, I prefer part 2 (the second half of the first book). While the source material is almost 60 years old, the notion of using ""prophecy"" as a means to control the masses, is as relevant today as it was then. I really like book adaptations where it's clear that the director is passionate and respectful of the source material. It's no secret the Villeneuve has loved Dune and planned on making his own version before he even made a movie. He even did Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 first, as to have the experience making sci-fi movies, so he felt adequately prepared to tackle Dune. It's too bad that he will not be adapting any more Dune books after Messiah. If you thought that Dune was still ""boring"" as I've heard some say, maybe sagas that are allegories for morals, religion and politics, aren't for you.",while i enjoy first dune much i prefer part second half first book while sourc materi almost year old notion use propheci mean control mass relev today i realli like book adapt clear director passion respect sourc materi it secret villeneuv love dune plan make version even made movi he even arriv blade runner first experi make scifi movi felt adequ prepar tackl dune it bad adapt dune book messiah if thought dune still bore ive heard say mayb saga allegori moral religion polit arent
"Dune: Part 2 strikes the perfect balance of storytelling, spectacle and character drama.

With all the scene setting and introductions of Part 1 out of the way, Part 2 is more compelling. The arc of Paul Atreides drives the story thanks to sensible creative decisions. He is not a likeable central character and not meant to be, but others are much worse so the filmmakers successfully manipulate you into investing in his fate. You can already feel a sense of foreboding for what is to come in Part 3.

The focus on his character development in the early section of the film before it changes and later merges plot lines works exceptionally well. It almost feels like a Game of Thrones season compacted into a single two and a half hour Lawrence of Arabia inspired theatrical release.

For me all actors are great and there are no weak links.

Much like Part 1, I think you need to watch it in a cinema in for the full effect. There are so many awesome audio-visual experiences it is hard to pick anything that stands out. From the early action sequence involving falling bodies you feel it's going to be something special and it sustains this standard throughout. I particularly like the use of the womb imagery in the early stages of the film and the mix of location footage with VFX is brilliant.

My only complaint is that some lines of dialogue to me sound slightly mumbled and not clear which requires replaying (sometimes with subtitles).

Many have described it as a sci-fi classic. Although pretty humourless, it is also hard to disagree, given it is fantastically well made and portrays the suffering associated with political power struggles and other underlying themes such as fate vs free will in an engaging piece of pop culture.

For me it is a 9.5/10, but I round upwards.",dune part strike perfect balanc storytel spectacl charact drama with scene set introduct part way part compel the arc paul atreid drive stori thank sensibl creativ decis he likeabl central charact meant other much wors filmmak success manipul invest fate you alreadi feel sen forebod come part the focu charact develop earli section film chang later merg plot line work except well it almost feel like game throne season compact singl two half hour lawrenc arabia inspir theatric releas for actor great weak link much like part i think need watch cinema full effect there mani awesom audiovisu experi hard pick anyth stand from earli action sequenc involv fall bodi feel go someth special sustain standard throughout i particularli like use womb imageri earli stage film mix locat footag vfx brilliant my complaint line dialogu sound slightli mumbl clear requir replay sometim subtitl mani describ scifi classic although pretti humourless also hard disagre given fantast well made portray suffer associ polit power struggl underli theme fate v free engag piec pop cultur for i round upward
"A loud space opera full of ethno kitsch

The second part of Dune repeats many of the problems of the first part. There are the lengthy static shots; instead of rhythm, a loud roar accompanies every scene that is supposed to have a dramatic effect. Sometimes less would have been more, Mr. Zimmer. It's as if the movie is selling the audience for fools, as if the projectionist turns up the volume a few decibels every other scene so that no one misses the great drama unfolding on the screen. Because the images are only sometimes able to tell the story. Certainly, the ride on the sandworm and the first raid on a Spice harvester fill the entire movie theater. Similarly, some characters such as Rebecca Fergurson or Austin Butler can certainly arouse interest with their mysterious nature. But then again, the story is too one-dimensional, the religious element is only scratched on the surface and the fight against the Harkonnen ultimately dissolves into a dune chase against Nazis. As a blockbuster, Dune 2 only lands in the midfield and does not live up to the overly enthusiastic reviews.",a loud space opera full ethno kitsch the second part dune repeat mani problem first part there lengthi static shot instead rhythm loud roar accompani everi scene suppos dramat effect sometim less would mr zimmer it movi sell audienc fool projectionist turn volum decibel everi scene one miss great drama unfold screen becaus imag sometim abl tell stori certainli ride sandworm first raid spice harvest fill entir movi theater similarli charact rebecca fergurson austin butler certainli arous interest mysteri natur but stori onedimension religi element scratch surfac fight harkonnen ultim dissolv dune chase nazi a blockbust dune land midfield live overli enthusiast review

"Not a smidge on Dune Part 1 (2021) and for this reason, also a big disappointment. Spent £19.99 to buy this, solely on the premise it had a higher rating than the first (which I loved).

Felt like watching a typical sequel, trying to follow the same format as the first but lacking the story and magic of the original. This makes no sense as it's based on a book so no need to scrape for ideas or scrimp on dialogue and character development. I felt a real connection when watching the first part but this left me high and dry.

A long build up to a rushed (anti) climax.

I don't hate this film in any way but come on, it's not a masterpiece even though it is visually spectacular.

"Dune: Part Two is absolutely brilliant, it's better than Part One in pretty much every way possible. Dune: Part One was just a setup, while Dune: Part Two truly is the real deal. Dune: Part Two is about Paul trying to gain the trust of the Fremen, at the beginning of the Movie there were many that believed Paul was the Messiah, but there were also many that didn't believe it. Anyway the final act of the Movie is by far the Best part, it includes a lot of action and breathtaking visuals. The acting was also incredible, the acting of the first Movie was already pretty great but the acting in this one is even better. I also loved Paul's character development in this one, seeing him go from being just the Duke's Son to becoming an all knowing hero who can see the future was incredible to watch.

"Very stylish, but in the end just more of Hollywood's very long and tired history of glorifying violence, encouraging violence, inspiring violence, embracing patriarchy, masculine toxicity, and simplistic, vengeful solutions to very one-dimensional fictional problems. It would be nice to have more serious, sincere, adult content that shows the complexity of the human condition, and shows more peaceful means of dealing with conflicts. It would be nice to have a film that embraces more complex themes than, well, war. The cinematography is spectacularly creative, but goes nowhere productive because the story is the same old Star Wars and pretty much everything before and after. Many times I stopped watching out of frustration with the story, but especially at the end I just had to sigh - another man-to-man fight to the death with lasers, oops, this time knives.

"Usually, before watching movies, I always visit the IMDB website, check out the ratings, and then if a movie has a rating of 7 or above, I give it a go. That's pretty much my routine with IMDB. But today, this movie has compelled me to take out some special time to come here and those who have made this movie ""DUNE"" deserve all the praise. Everyone who has watched this movie should genuinely rate it from their hearts. I wish IMDB could rate out of 100 so I could give this movie 100 out of 100, but here, the rating only goes up to a maximum of 10. I wish I could personally thank the writers, producers, directors, and every person involved in making this movie.

What a fantastic movie, buddy! I had goosebumps throughout the movie. The story buildup in the first part was amazing, and now, in this second part, the directors and everyone involved have taken it to a whole new level. I've come specifically to rate this movie on IMDB. There are very few movies I've ever rated, but this movie truly deserves nothing but positive ratings from every single person in the world. I can't understand some reviews where people have given it a 7 rating, saying that the plot or maybe the dialogue wasn't up to the mark. I can confidently say that those people just don't appreciate good movies.

Anyone who watches this movie will only have words of praise. There's no doubt about its epic-ness. I am absolutely speechless, and this movie is the biggest and most epic movie of my life.

"This is not going to be a popular review but I'm writing as someone who has read the book, is a fan of Villeneuve's work and couldn't wait for part 1. And even more part 2. To arrive. After watching the first movie I understood that those who had never read the book didn't get to appreciate how perfect job Denis Villeneuve had done, but fortunately many did, me among them, as it laid the path for the second part to unveil in it's glory. And in so many ways it did. Before I went to see this movie I've read the first reviews, especially the usually critical ones from the book fans and couldn't understand why're they always so picky, especially for Villeneuve, even if the movie in some of its parts strays away from the book. Never had that kind of critical view on the book adaptations as I understood that the directors job, freedom and subsequently risk is to choose a path and express their artistic interpretation. After viewing the second instalment I still don't see any bad things about how this movie was made regardless of it's differences from the book. It doesn't lose anything from the Dune story at all. Everything about this movie is top of the tops. Except one thing. My critical point about the second part of the Dune movie is the one of the most praised things in all the reviews. The musical score from the music grand master Hans Zimmer. Everyone praised it but I found way over the top, completely missed and messed up the whole vibe. Basically from the start this music and it's effects immerse you in extremely fearful and dark vibe sound pool that never leaves this 166min instalment. There are couple of times that the music atmosphere went to a calmer side but this was like ugly vibes all over the place, regardless who's in the scene... it was a constant. My take is that classic mixing the atmospheric sounds depending on the side showing would make it definitely better because the book doesn't have that evil vibe all the time at all. The book is a clear fight of good and evil and there are many divine or spiritual moments opposing the darkness in the book that emphasize that fight, light against the dark. Even prana the yogic life force of God (from vedic culture) is mentioned in the book. Among these sound effects that were shaking the whole hall, it was hard to swallow the voice of Lisan Al Gaib's demonic voice (as well as his mother) when he became one with everything, enhanced with a cruise ship subwoofer sound effect. That being said, Timothee Chalamet is not the best pick for the role, just can't see the charisma of Paul with his skinny appearance and face, standing tough like Ronaldo before taking the freekick. Paul should have eyes that speak everything and this Italian teenager lookalike, although good, just felt flat like he's trying to hard. Zendaya surprisingly great, constantly amazing Rebecca Ferguson has that charisma of stealing the screen presence and two best roles Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem made the center of the bullseye. Movie has the perfect scenery. Really everything is spot on but the music vibe kinda ruined it for me. That's not to say that mr. Hans Zimmer made a bad product, he did masterfully as always. But compared to the book it's too extreme, too dark or evil and missing the vibe of the story, in my humble opinion. I can see that dark things excite a lot of people today and so this music score is not a surprise in that way. But not for me. Another note, the media critics are writing about this movie grandiosity by comparing it to the Lord of the rings. Love and respect both but Dune doesn't come even close to LOTR masterpiece trilogy. This is another one of their empty, sensationalistic exaggerations.",thi go popular review im write someon read book fan villeneuv work couldnt wait part and even part to arriv after watch first movi i understood never read book didnt get appreci perfect job deni villeneuv done fortun mani among laid path second part unveil glori and mani way befor i went see movi ive read first review especi usual critic one book fan couldnt understand whyre alway picki especi villeneuv even movi part stray away book never kind critic view book adapt i understood director job freedom subsequ risk choos path express artist interpret after view second instal i still dont see bad thing movi made regardless differ book it doesnt lose anyth dune stori everyth movi top top except one thing my critic point second part dune movi one prais thing review the music score music grand master han zimmer everyon prais i found way top complet miss mess whole vibe basic start music effect immers extrem fear dark vibe sound pool never leav min instal there coupl time music atmospher went calmer side like ugli vibe place regardless who scene constant my take classic mix atmospher sound depend side show would make definit better book doesnt evil vibe time the book clear fight good evil mani divin spiritu moment oppos dark book emphas fight light dark even prana yogic life forc god vedic cultur mention book among sound effect shake whole hall hard swallow voic lisan al gaib demon voic well mother becam one everyth enhanc cruis ship subwoof sound effect that said timothe chalamet best pick role cant see charisma paul skinni appear face stand tough like ronaldo take freekick paul eye speak everyth italian teenag lookalik although good felt flat like he tri hard zendaya surprisingli great constantli amaz rebecca ferguson charisma steal screen presenc two best role josh brolin javier bardem made center bullsey movi perfect sceneri realli everyth spot music vibe kinda ruin that say mr han zimmer made bad product master alway but compar book extrem dark evil miss vibe stori humbl opinion i see dark thing excit lot peopl today music score surpris way but anoth note medium critic write movi grandios compar lord ring love respect dune doesnt come even close lotr masterpiec trilog thi anoth one empti sensationalist exagger

"I traveled an hour to watch this in IMAX, and the result it shows clearly tells us why we should watch movies in theaters, especially like this, which is made in such a way that you will remember and cherish it forever, clearly an epitome in the sci-fi genre.

And oh man, the consistency of Denis Villeneuve to make such good films one after another is just damn good. The music score by Lord Hans Zimmer was phenomenal, especially in the climax, and with the visual by Greig Fraser, he truly captivates the whole beauty of the Dune in such a colossal way that each frame is just mesmerizing and leaves you in awe, especially the world of Giedi Prime. The moment I saw that Harkonnen arena, it made me feel eerie and created a fear in me. The only problem for me was some fast paced scenes when they reached the south for water of life.

Clearly, watching it in IMAX surely escalates the experience for me, which makes it one of my most memorable movie going experiences.

"Imagine you lived in the '60s and someone produced the first IMAX experience for Lawrence of Arabia. How shocked would you have been? How great of a cinematic experience would you have thought it was had that existed in the '60s?

This is what Dune Part 2 made me feel, but better. Villeneuve, Fraser, and Zimmer have adapted the brilliant and intricate story of Arrakis and have scaled it to a level you've never seen before unless mentioned in the breath of The Lord of the Rings among others. The Arrakis we see feels so visceral, so tangible, we feel like we are there with the Fremen and live among them.

Villeneuve didn't care too much for the action sequences, but rather the substance and depth of Paul Atreides' arc. To have this rather than being bombarded with action scenes for two hours like the typical IMAX experience feels so refreshing and shows why Denis Villeneuve is such a film purist. This is the essence of cinema: great cinematographic sequences where every single frame can be captured and hung in The Louvre and every single frame has the depth to tell a thousand meanings and has to be seen multiple times.

Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, every single cast member put everything into their roles and its the most sensational thing you'll ever see. There's a scene that Chalamet is the heart of and it'll make your jaw drops. He certainly is the future of Hollywood.

"Dune part 2 is one of the best looking and sounding movies (if not the best) ever created. Everything pertaining to the overall feel of the movie is an absolute achievement. The intro scene sets to stage for what can only be described as a modern day masterpiece of filmmaking. That being said, I feel this movie falls short in similar ways to part 1, specifically the ""battle"" sequence at the end of the movie which had the opportunity to go down as one of the greatest battles of all time yet failed to deliver and was incredibly rushed. The pacing through the middle half to 2/3 of the movie felt slow, I feel like they could have pulled 10 minutes out of that section and made a more powerful battle/ ending sequence to the movie. Additionally, the character Feyd Harconnen felt a bit underdeveloped given the effort put into his exposition scene. All in all, a must see and one of the better releases in recent memory.",dune part one best look sound movi best ever creat everyth pertain overal feel movi absolut achiev the intro scene set stage describ modern day masterpiec filmmak that said i feel movi fall short similar way part specif battl sequenc end movi opportun go one greatest battl time yet fail deliv incred rush the pace middl half movi felt slow i feel like could pull minut section made power battl end sequenc movi addit charact feyd harconnen felt bit underdevelop given effort put exposit scene all must see one better releas recent memori
"I just watched Dune: Part 2 in theaters, and it was so worth it. Just like the first movie, the visuals, the musical score, the characters, the plot, and almost everything in between was excellent. The transformation that Paul experiences through this movie brought everything to an epic crescendo that was well deserving of the big screen.

Compared to the Lynch version back in the day, Dune: Part 2 develops the emotional tensions between various characters so much more effectively, leaving me with a strong desire for Dune: Messiah to come out as soon as possible. If it is equal to the first two movies, this will be a trilogy for the ages!",i watch dune part theater worth just like first movi visual music score charact plot almost everyth excel the transform paul experi movi brought everyth epic crescendo well deserv big screen compar lynch version back day dune part develop emot tension variou charact much effect leav strong desir dune messiah come soon possibl if equal first two movi trilog age
"This movie has received a tremendous amount of praise and hype. I was really looking forward to it because I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment. While Dune 2 is visually stunning, in my opinion the film is no masterpiece - certainly not on par with sequels like The Empire Strikes Back or The Two Towers. There were fun moments for sure, but to me, the overall story arc, the pacing, the character development - most of it fell flat. There was really no character I could care about or root for. The score by the great Hans Zimmer was forgettable. And the casting of Christopher Walken as the Emperor was a mistake. I came away disappointed.",thi movi receiv tremend amount prais hype i realli look forward i thoroughli enjoy first instal while dune visual stun opinion film masterpiec certainli par sequel like the empir strike back the two tower there fun moment sure overal stori arc pace charact develop fell flat there realli charact i could care root the score great han zimmer forgett and cast christoph walken emperor mistak i came away disappoint
"This movie is the best movie I've seen. Period. My boyfriend and I were in awe walking out of the theater, we saw it playing again right after our showing and both didn't hesitate to buy tickets to see it again the same night. The music is incredible, acting phenomenal, visual effects are out of this world, cinematography is absolutely insane. Dune is such a rich story and the universe Frank Herbert created is so incredible. Nothing about it is really like our world; everything from the weapons to the equipment to even the characters is nothing like Earth. It's so unique and fantastic and Part 2 really drives that home. One of the best sequels I've ever seen - people were literally on the edge of their seats watching the entire movie. Never was there anything that didn't have a purpose or felt like filler, and yet it's almost 3 hours long.

"Dune Part 2 exceeds all expectations, delivering a mesmerizing cinematic experience that leaves audiences spellbound. Director Denis Villeneuve's masterful vision brings Frank Herbert's epic universe to life with stunning visuals and an immersive narrative. The ensemble cast shines, with Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides anchoring the film with depth and charisma. Part 2 delves deeper into the complex politics and mythology of Arrakis, captivating viewers with its intricate storytelling and breathtaking action sequences. Hans Zimmer's score elevates every moment, evoking a sense of grandeur and tension.

"...this was an amazing experience to witness in the cinema.

Besides these Villeneuve-directed Dune films, when it comes to sci-fi I've only ever liked the original Star Wars, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the Blade Runner films - the ladder also directed by Villeneuve.

What makes Dune (and especially this sequel) stand out from those other sci-fi classics is that these Dune films have so much more 'edge'.

It's like the story, the sound and the visuals (oh my, the visuals!) just hits you and cuts through you with their force of impact ...and it feels amazing.

Did I like part one of Dune? Yes!

Did I like part two of Dune even more? Yes!

Am I beyond excited for part three of Dune? Yes!!!

So from a guy who has only liked about 5 sci-fi films before these, I wholeheartedly recommend these incredible films for those who might think they look a bit too much sci-fi.

If you love sci-fi I feel like these films may go down as being considered the best ever - undoubtedly mentioned in those lines by sci-fi geeks (endearingly meant) for the rest of time.",amaz experi wit cinema besid villeneuvedirect dune film come scifi ive ever like origin star war the hitchhik guid galaxi blade runner film ladder also direct villeneuv what make dune especi sequel stand scifi classic dune film much edg it like stori sound visual oh visual hit cut forc impact feel amaz did i like part one dune ye did i like part two dune even ye am i beyond excit part three dune ye so guy like scifi film i wholeheartedli recommend incred film might think look bit much scifi if love scifi i feel like film may go consid best ever undoubtedli mention line scifi geek endearingli meant rest time

"I did not expect this much for the sequel as we all know almost all the sequels are not really great. But, this one is totally different.

The cinematography, the plot, the character development, the visuals are just perfect.

Timothee is perfect for Paul. Zendaya slayed the role and most of all, Lady Jessica ate all the crumps. I have never seen the character that is so perfect like that.

It's so much better if you guys can experience this film on cinemas. My experience out there watching it on cinema is one of a true kind of cinematic experience.

So I recommend all of you to go and enjoy this one while you still have opportunity.",i expect much sequel know almost sequel realli great but one total differ the cinematographi plot charact develop visual perfect timothe perfect paul zendaya slay role ladi jessica ate crump i never seen charact perfect like it much better guy experi film cinema my experi watch cinema one true kind cinemat experi so i recommend go enjoy one still opportun
"A good film amongst the dryness of today's film-making.

It is worth to watch in the cinema, but not as good as the first part.

The atmosphere of the 1st part is missing. Even more, it never felt like the world-building that was accomplished in part 1, was now taken one step forward.

The pacing was not good. At points becoming tiring and at points rushed.

More than half of the film is spent in pointless and tiresome dialogue about becoming or not becoming the Lisan Al Gaib.

It's like the movie had a task list of things to show and did go through them all ticking checkboxes, without having air to breathe.

Aside from the 2 protagonists, there are no deep characters here. Just caricatures helping with the proceedings.

For those of us who had watched the previous version, there were no surprises, no cliffhangers. Aside from imagery and effects, one could argue that the 1984 version was better, deeper and richer, even though it was only one film compared to today's parts 1 and 2.

Sorry to spoil the party but it takes a lot more to be compared with the biggest sci-fi movies of the past.",a good film amongst dryness today filmmak it worth watch cinema good first part the atmospher st part miss even never felt like worldbuild accomplish part taken one step forward the pace good at point becom tire point rush more half film spent pointless tiresom dialogu becom becom lisan al gaib it like movi task list thing show go tick checkbox without air breath asid protagonist deep charact just caricatur help proceed for u watch previou version surpris cliffhang asid imageri effect one could argu version better deeper richer even though one film compar today part sorri spoil parti take lot compar biggest scifi movi past
"How is this a 'masterpiece' there are of course worse films but I just don't get what others are seeing, through the two films over 6 hours the storyline is so poorly developed, the world is still not really explained there's no depth to much at all There is lots of sand and religious sort of nonsense, some blue water, some more sand, some prophecy, some bang average action loads of plot holes, some big worms. I hoped part 2 made part 1 make more sense when instead I've got even more questions where by that's a failure of the screen play after 6 hours it should either be concluded and all plot lines concluded or have opened up enough to want to see more, in the end I feel I've wasted 6 hours wanting to see what all the fuss is about and I still don't get it.",how masterpiec cours wors film i dont get other see two film hour storylin poorli develop world still realli explain there depth much there lot sand religi sort nonsens blue water sand propheci bang averag action load plot hole big worm i hope part made part make sen instead ive got even question that failur screen play hour either conclud plot line conclud open enough want see end i feel ive wast hour want see fuss i still dont get

There's an unprecedented intensity to some scenes and moments. On the other hand, the character scenes are intimate and deeply felt.

"I'll say right away that I love Frank Herbert's universe, I'm a fan of this amazing, realistic and frightening world. With lots of intrigue and conspiracies.

I read the first three books before Dune 2021 came out. By the way, even when I read the books I realized that this book is VERY hard to adapt and even harder to make a quality movie. As we remember the first attempts were, to put it mildly, not very good...

When Denis Villeneuve was appointed director, I realized that the films would have a CHANCE for something good, because this director can not do bad, all his films are close to masterpieces of cinema. When I watched the first movie I was delighted, the movie was very worthy. I gave Dune: Part One - 10 out of 10. But when I watched the second part..... This movie was half a head better than the first part. Dune: Part Two is perfect in almost every frame it takes.

Let's go in order. Music - the brilliant Hans Zimmer was responsible for this aspect of the movie. And he's outdone himself!, every song fits perfectly!

The editing and camerawork are beyond praise.

The cast, well, that's... one of the most stellar casts in movie history. And everyone's performance was worthy.

As a fan of the source material, I can say that not everything is screened exactly as in the book, and in some places it came out BETTER than in the book.

Before going to the theater (IMAX) I read the first reviews and they were all very positive, and I expected a good movie, but I'll be honest I didn't think it was that good. The movie amazed me.

From the beginning to the last frame it is an unequivocal masterpiece of cinema!

11 out of 10!!!

P. S. I hope the movie grosses over $1 million dollars at the box office, it deserves it.

P. S. Thank you Denis Villeneuve for everything you do. You and your team have done an amazing job!)",ill say right away i love frank herbert univers im fan amaz realist frighten world with lot intrigu conspiraci i read first three book dune came by way even i read book i realiz book veri hard adapt even harder make qualiti movi a rememb first attempt put mildli good when deni villeneuv appoint director i realiz film would chanc someth good director bad film close masterpiec cinema when i watch first movi i delight movi worthi i gave dune part one but i watch second part thi movi half head better first part dune part two perfect almost everi frame take let go order music brilliant han zimmer respons aspect movi and he outdon everi song fit perfectli the edit camerawork beyond prais the cast well that one stellar cast movi histori and everyon perform worthi a fan sourc materi i say everyth screen exactli book place came better book befor go theater imax i read first review posit i expect good movi ill honest i didnt think good the movi amaz from begin last frame unequivoc masterpiec cinema p s i hope movi gross million dollar box offic deserv p s thank deni villeneuv everyth you team done amaz job

"Dune: Part Two is one of the best produced films I have ever seen. The cinematography, casting, direction and special effects are all phenomenal. The filmmakers have paid intricate attention to detail and it shows throughout the movie.

The film follows two strong-willed lovers who are among the many fighters on the planet Arrakis. Paul wants to destroy the people who killed his family, but foresees a dangerous future. That same force is messing with his mind and may ruin his plan to save their people.

Some of your favorite actors are in Dune: Part Two! The main characters are Paul or Uzul (Timothée Chalamet), Chani (Zendaya), Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Emperor (Christopher Walken). The casting is fantastic; each actor compliments their characters beautifully and believably. I felt many emotions while watching it because of the great acting. When Chani is hurt by Uzul's sudden change of mind, the air feels tense and her anger is shown. Also, Uzul's mom, Jessica, is mysterious and changes her personality when she drinks the poison. This film is so well-produced. I am beyond amazed by the quality of the production. The camerawork captures the scenes so well, especially when they are in the desert. The special effects are mind-blowing, like when Uzul and Chani blow up multiple helicopters. The machine they are running from looks incredibly realistic and threatening. When Uzul has visions, the special effects are well-displayed. We learn that, by consuming Spice, the people on Arrakis can see the future. You know when they are seeing the future because their eyes turn blue. This film exceeds all my expectations and explores science fiction beautifully. The pacing is perhaps a bit off, but you might expect some slow parts since it is nearly three hours long! A lot of hard work went into creating this film. I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One to understand the concepts, the characters and their backstories. Dune: Part 2 picks up right where Dune: Part One left off. These two films really bring the Dune books to life. I applaud the director, Denis Villeneuve, for creating such admirable work. My favorite part of the film is when Paul (or Uzul) learns to ride a huge sandworm. The special effects are remarkable because you feel as if you are on the sandworm with him - the wind rushes, the sand flies everywhere, and the motion of the sandworm is smooth. It looks incredibly realistic and it shows how far CGI has come.

The film's message is to have hope and to always believe it can happen. Paul's hope carries him throughout his fights and he constantly encourages the others to believe that they can do it. He also tells his mother to not give them false hope over a prophecy. Be aware that this film has mature concepts, a lot of violence, profanity, and bloody scenes.

"I found the 2021 ""Dune: Part One"" to be an okay movie, though I wasn't overly impressed, so I wasn't in any particular rush to get to sit down and watch the 2024 sequel ""Dune: Part Two"". But I eventually got around to it.

Writers Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts did cram more enjoyable contents in the storyline here in the second part. And that made it a more watchable and entertaining movie to sit through. Now, I have never read any of the novels written by Frank Herbert, so I don't know how true the writers were to the source material. But regardless, it did make for an entertaining movie.

I found the storyline to be more compelling and interesting in this sequel, compared to the previous movie. And all the action definitely helped to add to the enjoyment that is ""Dune: Part Two"".

The acting performances are good, and they have a good cast ensemble. And it definitely is nice to have cast members from the 2021 movie return to reprise their roles and characters in this sequel.

Visually impressive, the CGI and effects help bring the world of Arrakis to life on the screen in a very convincing and enjoyable manner. And the movie is also a display of an impressive soundscape, and thus deserves to be played with a proper speaker system capable of doing the movie justice.

""Dune: Part Two"" is an enjoyable movie, though a bit long. And definitely a step up from the predecessor.

My rating of director Denis Villeneuve's 2024 movie ""Dune: Part Two"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",i found dune part one okay movi though i wasnt overli impress i wasnt particular rush get sit watch sequel dune part two but i eventu got around writer deni villeneuv jon spaiht cram enjoy content storylin second part and made watchabl entertain movi sit now i never read novel written frank herbert i dont know true writer sourc materi but regardless make entertain movi i found storylin compel interest sequel compar previou movi and action definit help add enjoy dune part two the act perform good good cast ensembl and definit nice cast member movi return repris role charact sequel visual impress cgi effect help bring world arraki life screen convinc enjoy manner and movi also display impress soundscap thu deserv play proper speaker system capabl movi justic dune part two enjoy movi though bit long and definit step predecessor my rate director deni villeneuv movi dune part two land seven ten star
"A very very good movie.

The story picks up basically right after the first movie, as the plot gets deeper and deeper throughout the movie I will give a general gist.

Paul is battling the fact he is the prophecy while his mother goes above and beyond to prove it. Chani and Paul grow closer over his time becoming a Fremen as she vows to stick with him as he remains who he is.

Beast is struggling with the Fremen attacks to stop the spice harvesting, his brother Feyd is brought in as he is a psychopath and they need someone crazy to eliminate the threat.

The whole movie is a religious and power struggle battle. The north, and south in contrast while they all seek a leader, it's a very strong movie in that sense.

The acting is top notch from EVERYONE!!! Timothee really has his movie, the second half he SHOWS his chops and wow, one of his strongest performances in my opinion.

It's hard to pick out others as they are ALL so strong, his mother plays a vicious role superbly, Austin Butler is great as a crazed killer power hungry lunatic, all great.

The score and visuals go without saying, Cinema experience needed for this one.

I gave the first a lower score it wasn't for me, but this was great, 9/10.",a good movi the stori pick basic right first movi plot get deeper deeper throughout movi i give gener gist paul battl fact propheci mother goe beyond prove chani paul grow closer time becom fremen vow stick remain beast struggl fremen attack stop spice harvest brother feyd brought psychopath need someon crazi elimin threat the whole movi religi power struggl battl the north south contrast seek leader strong movi sen the act top notch everyon timothe realli movi second half show chop wow one strongest perform opinion it hard pick other all strong mother play viciou role superbl austin butler great craze killer power hungri lunat great the score visual go without say cinema experi need one i gave first lower score wasnt great
"I liked the first movie and was looking forward to seeing the sequel. It adheres to the book plot pretty well, but unfortunately it focuses to much in the action sequences, as many sequels tend to do, instead of focusing more on the characters and therefor I feel it gets way to simplified. The brutality of the villains in most parts cliché and doesn't feel genuine at all. There is much more to dig into in the relationship between Paul and the mother as well as Paul and Chani. All in all it is a good enough film, but it could have been much more. It would be a sad affair if a sequel to this follow the same track.",i like first movi look forward see sequel it adher book plot pretti well unfortun focus much action sequenc mani sequel tend instead focus charact therefor i feel get way simplifi the brutal villain part clich doesnt feel genuin there much dig relationship paul mother well paul chani all good enough film could much it would sad affair sequel follow track
"I went into Dune: Part Two expecting a masterpiece given all the hype, but it left me completely underwhelmed. The storyline feels weak, slow, and overly complicated without a satisfying payoff, and I struggled to stay engaged.

The cinematography is impressive, sure, but good visuals alone don't make up for the lackluster narrative. The characters felt underdeveloped, and the pacing dragged so much that I eventually had to switch it off-it was simply too boring.

If you're into futuristic, desert-based sci-fi, Furiosa or Mad Max do a much better job of keeping you entertained. Overall, Dune: Part Two just didn't live up to the acclaim for me.",i went dune part two expect masterpiec given hype left complet underwhelm the storylin feel weak slow overli complic without satisfi payoff i struggl stay engag the cinematographi impress sure good visual alon dont make lacklust narr the charact felt underdevelop pace drag much i eventu switch offit simpli bore if your futurist desertbas scifi furiosa mad max much better job keep entertain overal dune part two didnt live acclaim
"In so many ways, Dune: Part 2 is all you could ever ask for from a big screen spectacle with an added bonus that this visual feast and sensory shattering blockbuster has the heart and soul to match, making director Denis Villeneuve's and his casts return to the sand clad world of Arrakis one that will not soon be forgotten in the history of the cinematic medium.

A victim of last years Hollywood strikes, which saw Villeneuve's much anticipated follow-up to his beloved first entry from 2021 get moved from a late 2023 roll-out to its end of Feb release this year, Part 2 is well and truly worth the extra wait eager cinemagoers have had to endure with this eye-popping epic as good of a reason as there has ever been to get off your couch and give your home cinema a well-deserved break to get out and see what Villeneuve has in store for you, with what can only be described as the quintessential example of what can be delivered on the big screen format.

From the haunting beauty of the unforgiving plains of Arrakis (aka Abu Dhabi) where Paul and his new Fremen friends wander, the almost rollercoaster like experience of sandworm riding, the black and white majesty and horror of our first trip to the Harkonnen owned planet of Giedi Prime, the stunningly staged battles both externally and internally through to the unforgettable world building of Hans Zimmer's instantly iconic score, Part 2 is an all-round success that builds on what was special about Part 1 and enhances it at all times.

Throughout this technical marvel we are also treated to the official arrival of the next stage of the already memorable career of lead Timothée Chalamet, who here brings Paul Atreides's journey from meek boy to what many see as a life-changing messiah sent to save them from the oppressiveness they have felt for ages gone by in a fashion that is awards worthy.

It's a career-defining performance from Chalamet, it's been sometime since I can recall seeing such growth and screen presence come to life before our eyes but its more and more evident in Part 2 as the films never dull close to three hour runtime moves forward with Villeneuve and his cast never wasting a single second of screentime on anything that feels like excess baggage or unwarranted diversions, this is a film with a singular vision that never panders down to its audience and treats its material with a respect and reverence that can proudly sit alongside the likes of The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the original Star Wars trilogy for world building, creation and characters being sprung to life.

Arriving at a time in the history of cinema where debates are raging about the future viability and even keenness from audiences to support the world of move-making on a grand-scale, Part 2 can be looked at much like Paul Atreides is seen by the blue-eyed faithful that watch his every move, a messiah of sorts coming along to remind us all of what the possibilities are, all delivered by the grand puppet master that is Denis Villeneuve who has here, without question or debate, marked himself down as one of the all-time great filmmakers.

Across the span of just over a decade, the French Canadian mastermind has managed a set of films that are up there with as good of a run as we've ever seen with 2010's Incendies starting a run of Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part 1 and now Dune: Part 2. 8 incredible films that show no signs of slowing down anytime soon and we as audience members should be happy to be witnesses and partakers in such a career that could be this generations defining one alongside Christopher Nolan.

With everyone and everything at the top of their game, from Rebecca Ferguson's noteworthy turn as Lady Jessica, Austin Butler's scene-stealing villain Feyd-Rautha, cinematographer Greig Fraser's masterful camerawork, Jacqueline West's costume design and art direction and set decoration that puts most Hollywood productions to shame, Part 2 is as alive as a film could be, a Sci-Fi masterpiece that in turn bares witness to blockbuster entertainment can and should be, making Part 2 the very definition of a must-see cinema spectacle.

Final Say -

Upping the game in every facet, Dune: Part 2 is the perfect progression of the already great Part 1, gifting us a chance to enjoy a feast for the senses like very few films have provided us over the course of cinema history. Filled with memorable set pieces, noteworthy performances and much to ponder, Dune: Part 2 is an all-round success story that deserves all the praise that is being heaped upon it.

"Dune: Part Two: Sand, Sand, and more effing Sand! There is a certain Monty Phytonesque touch to Dune: Part Two. Paul insists he;s not the Messiah yet we get a scene straight out of Life of Brian with a gaggle of Fremen giggling as they proclaim him as the Messiah. This is a serious issue though; Chani (Zendaya) and other young Fremen reject the idea of a Messiah as something that holds them back and oppose the more conservative people. Chani still admire Paul though and their relationship flourishes as the narrative unfolds. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson) becomes Reverend Mother of the Fremen, surviving a grueling, deadly ritual. She heads south to win over the Fundamentalist Fremen to Paul's cause as the Messiah. The Emperor Christopher Walken) also casts a beady eye on Arrakis, his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) however is very much a creature of the Bene Gesserit. The Harkonnens continue to oppress the Fremen but the failure of Glisssu Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) to inflict a telling defeat lead to his replacement by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's (Stellan Skarsgård) youngest nephew and heir (""na-Baron"") to House Harkonnen. All of these threads eventually entwine as the film heads towards it's conclusion.

Great battle scenes which at times reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia as armies on foot clash in great numbers and engage in sword fights. The one to one duels are also captivatingly cruel. The desert is very much a supporting actor as Paul earns his spurs as a Fremen fighter with the help of Chani. The guerrilla tactics of the Fremen are convincingly displayed as they destroy ornithopters and spice gathering machines, The war of the Flea at work. Villenue appears to be drawing analogies as he shows the ornithopters targeting people on the ground and the destruction of a Fremen habitat as collective punishment but make yiur own mind up about that. Butler plays Feyd-Rautha as a murderous sociopath who will do anything to achieve results to please Baron Harkonnen. He kills at will to provide human food for his three cannibal concubines. Too many in the ensemble cast to name them all but some great performances. All in all a triumph, Villenue may not be minded to make any sequels but I hope his directorial baton will be lifted by a suitable successor. Directed by Denis Villeneuve who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. 9/10.",dune part two sand sand ef sand there certain monti phytonesqu touch dune part two paul insist he messiah yet get scene straight life brian gaggl fremen giggl proclaim messiah thi seriou issu though chani zendaya young fremen reject idea messiah someth hold back oppos conserv peopl chani still admir paul though relationship flourish narr unfold ladi jessica rebecca fergusson becom reverend mother fremen surviv gruel deadli ritual she head south win fundamentalist fremen paul caus messiah the emperor christoph walken also cast beadi eye arraki daughter princess irulan florenc pugh howev much creatur bene gesserit the harkonnen continu oppress fremen failur glisssu harkonnen dave bautista inflict tell defeat lead replac feydrautha harkonnen austin butler baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgrd youngest nephew heir nabaron hous harkonnen all thread eventu entwin film head toward conclus great battl scene time remind lawrenc arabia armi foot clash great number engag sword fight the one one duel also captivatingli cruel the desert much support actor paul earn spur fremen fighter help chani the guerrilla tactic fremen convincingli display destroy ornithopt spice gather machin the war flea work villenu appear draw analog show ornithopt target peopl ground destruct fremen habitat collect punish make yiur mind butler play feydrautha murder sociopath anyth achiev result plea baron harkonnen he kill provid human food three cannib concubin too mani ensembl cast name great perform all triumph villenu may mind make sequel i hope directori baton lift suitabl successor direct deni villeneuv cowrot screenplay jon spaiht
"Dune one was great, it had everything you really wanted in a sci fi and couldn't really have gotten much better. Dune 2 completely blows it out of the water. This movie does absolutely everything better. Maybe my favourite part of the movie, the soundtrack was phenomenal. It might very well be hans zimmers best.

Fantastic preformances from the entire A list cast. Timothee chalamet proves yet again what a versatile actor he is, undoubtedly one of the best of the next generation. But the star preformance of the movie was definitely Austin butler. The cinematography was breathtaking even for Denis vilneuve.

"I think there are so many things to talk about this movie so let's keep it ""simple"". This film is absolutely incredible, it's a masterpiece, a work of art. Besides that I think this is also one of the most important films ever made. It accomplishes so much on so many levels. For example, when was the last time we saw a science-fiction movie with masterclass acting, deep characters, perfect cinematography, immaculate sound design (the list could go on...) and that is adapted from a novel?! But more specifically, I believe this film showed us the true power of CGI and how to use it properly. It was nearly invisible and it blended perfectly with the rest of the footage. Denis Villeneuve just took us somewhere no one had ever been and it truly is an undescribable experience. He made a perfect use of wide shots, lenses and filters. Adding to that is the immaculate sound design. Hans Zimmer yet again makes an incredible original score and Villeneuve compliments it with the perfect background noises. One thing is for sure though, this is a movie to see in theatre. For me, this was the best theatre experience ever. So if you can go see it I highly recommend to go see it before it leaves to go into streaming.",i think mani thing talk movi let keep simpl thi film absolut incred masterpiec work art besid i think also one import film ever made it accomplish much mani level for exampl last time saw sciencefict movi masterclass act deep charact perfect cinematographi immacul sound design list could go adapt novel but specif i believ film show u true power cgi use properli it nearli invis blend perfectli rest footag deni villeneuv took u somewher one ever truli undescrib experi he made perfect use wide shot lens filter ad immacul sound design han zimmer yet make incred origin score villeneuv compliment perfect background nois one thing sure though movi see theatr for best theatr experi ever so go see i highli recommend go see leav go stream
"First off, this movie is epic and badass -- what more could you ask of a movie? This is why we go the the cinemas. There are so many moments that will make you have goosebumps, and what more could you want from a movie? The fact that this movie even exists is crazy. The sheer scale of this masterpiece is mindblowing. How can you go back to watching a normal movie after this? It's easier to name a few minor problems than writing 20 pages of praise.

This is an all-star cast with a lot of talent. Chalamet is outstanding and he has shown why he is a true movie star. He was frightening on screen. I was ready to bow and call him my king. And Zendaya delivers a masterclass in acting. She is the heart of the movie and her performance moved me. Butler is also phenomenal, but the problem is that he did not get a lot of screen time. When he's there, he is amazing, but he is barely in the film! It was, honestly, disappointing to have such a great villain and performance not be in the movie longer. It was anticlimactic.

The whole movie builds up to the final showdown between the houses. It's cool, I guess, but it does not have any real kick. There does not seem to be any stakes. The big action sequences were not as great as the first one. It works, but it's nothing special. The story is the most interesting with Paul's (Chalamet) journey and transformation. Also, the more intimate action sequences, only featuring a handful of characters, are incredible (for example: the harvester scenes and the knife fight).

With that being said, this might be the greatest film ever. Everything good is just so great. Never has a movie reached this high before.",first movi epic badass could ask movi thi go cinema there mani moment make goosebump could want movi the fact movi even exist crazi the sheer scale masterpiec mindblow how go back watch normal movi it easier name minor problem write page prais thi allstar cast lot talent chalamet outstand shown true movi star he frighten screen i readi bow call king and zendaya deliv masterclass act she heart movi perform move butler also phenomen problem get lot screen time when he amaz bare film it honestli disappoint great villain perform movi longer it anticlimact the whole movi build final showdown hous it cool i guess real kick there seem stake the big action sequenc great first one it work noth special the stori interest paul chalamet journey transform also intim action sequenc featur hand charact incred exampl harvest scene knife fight with said might greatest film ever everyth good great never movi reach high
"DUNE IS THE BEST SCIENCE-FICTION AND IT WILL BE THE BEST SAGA OF ALL TIME.

Words can't describe my feelings for this.

A movie that leaves you speachless and shaking. A truly cinematic experience that could only be made by Denis Villenueve.

Dune I is as incredible as this one, but has a problem, since they have to introduce you all those futuristic terms and lore, they do it chaotically, so its more dificult to understand, and in the second, all is tied and you can follow it better.

All performance are incredible as they should since the actors are incredible talented.

Chani turned out to be my favorite charecter. Denis and Fran wrote her amazingly. Shes a girlboss, i hope she slaps Paul in the face.

Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya are gorgeous, they look at the screen and im dead, very beautiful women. Great Casting.

I was scared beforen seeing this movie, because when i saw the first one i was a little scared scine everything was new to me and the movie is so well done that makes you feel things.

"I expected more with all the critics' reviews (that were probably hyped in a poor movie season). The movie was too long, with unfocussed direction, odd narrative shifts and confusing battle scenes. The CGI in the arena fight was cringy-bad. After all this, the director clearly pointed the way to another sequel. Ho hum. It's interesting that Hollywood is plowing so much money into films that require you to have read the book before in order to understand what all this noise is about. Without knowing the book, this would be an incomprehensible film. Actually, the director's attempt to make it as true to the book as possible has made it less of a film.",i expect critic review probabl hype poor movi season the movi long unfocuss direct odd narr shift confus battl scene the cgi arena fight cringybad after director clearli point way anoth sequel ho hum it interest hollywood plow much money film requir read book order understand nois without know book would incomprehens film actual director attempt make true book possibl made less film
"Honestly this movie rejuvenated my belief that good movies could still be made. It was well written, well casted, well directed, beautiful, and the score was on point.

There were a few moment where me and my friends just screamed, not out of fear or excitement but just as a guttural reaction and release of built up emotion.

It's a long movie, surely. I wouldn't recommend going at midnight. But go at 1pm in the afternoon like we did - and you'll be delighted.

Don't miss this one. See it in theaters. There aren't many movies quite as good as this that have ever been made.

"I'm first and foremast a fan of the books and I liked all the previous iterations of the books on the big and small screen.

Chalamet never was my first choice in casting. He's amazing in CMBYN but elsewhere he tends to revert to a Batman voice that muffles all that charisma he has. Paul is not muffled and withdrawn.

And to be frank, Chalamet could put on 50 lbs and still be too skinny and weak to play someone who can fight.

The movie LOOKS amazing. Stellar. The casting of Chalamet, ZENDAYA AND Pugh left me scratching my head. Both Dukes, Paul's mom, all the Harkonens, great casting and performances.

My biggest beef is how much the plot here insisted on an unwilling Messiah, unlike the source material.

That and an already meh performance from Chalamet made this the only iteration of the books that i have no desire to watch again.

Does not live up to the hype.

"I watched both parts recently and am a fan of the book series as well the 2000s mini series.

Just like in the first movie the cast and their performance is good. The visual effects also are impressive.

However the story in the movie is still very lackluster. It's messy and has been changed in various aspects. I'm not a fan of these changes. They've added conflicts within the Fremen which based on the portrayal in the movie are based on gender. The men are more influenced by the ideological propaganda of the Bene Gesserit while the female Fremen are more driven non-religious rationality. It's not something that was in the books and I don't like it here as it is Hollywood stuff...

Also once again a lot of things from the Dune story are just glanced over while other minor aspects are unnecessarily dragged out and additional drivel is added which makes this feel like a subpar Dune fan fiction.

One additional issue I'm seeing as well as the chemistry between the main characters Paul and Chani. Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet have absolutely zero chemistry. There's no visible love or relationship there. In addition Chani as a character was changed in the movie compared to the book. To fully understand the changes and why this is terrible you should read (or listen to) the book and then compare it to the movie. It's all off in various aspects.

Some characters also have been cut from the story (almost) entirely (Alia for example). It changes the whole dynamic of the story and makes it way messier. Once again it unfortunately just feels like a waste of resources and seeing this I just would've loved to see the team doing the 2000's mini series could've done with a similar budget as they told the story well while dealing with limitations on presentation or effects. Give that old series a try if you can. It still holds up in terms of content in my opinion.",i watch part recent fan book seri well mini seri just like first movi cast perform good the visual effect also impress howev stori movi still lacklust it messi chang variou aspect im fan chang theyv ad conflict within fremen base portray movi base gender the men influenc ideolog propaganda bene gesserit femal fremen driven nonreligi ration it someth book i dont like hollywood stuff also lot thing dune stori glanc minor aspect unnecessarili drag addit drivel ad make feel like subpar dune fan fiction one addit issu im see well chemistri main charact paul chani zendaya timoth chalamet absolut zero chemistri there visibl love relationship in addit chani charact chang movi compar book to fulli understand chang terribl read listen book compar movi it variou aspect some charact also cut stori almost entir alia exampl it chang whole dynam stori make way messier onc unfortun feel like wast resourc see i wouldv love see team mini seri couldv done similar budget told stori well deal limit present effect give old seri tri it still hold term content opinion
"Dune Part Two is what Empire Strikes Back is to Star Wars, Two Towers is to Lord of the Rings, a cinematic sequel to an already great film that when put together creates a masterful piece of story telling. It is not 100 percent accurate to the book however it is faithful in its telling, it has the writing, the cinematography, acting, sound, music and visuals to back it all up too. It's not a perfect film, you can certainly nitpick at little things but I am jaw dropped by this movie. Nearly three hours flies by. Everyone involved in this film should feel proud, cinema is back!

Dune chapter 2 a follow up to Frank Herberts science fiction series definitely lived up to the high expectations set by its predecessor but also exceeded them in every possible aspect. The way the story was told captivated audiences immersing them in a narrative that was both expansive and intimately personal. This installment explored the dynamics of the Atreides family, their allies and adversaries unveiling the politics of the universe with remarkable precision and depth that kept me fully engaged.

"I am sorry to rip your dreams apart, but it is my task to get everybody back on the ground and clear the internet from misinformation.

Some people said this movie would be our generation's Empire Strikes Back. Yes, somebody wrote that. After watching Dune: Part Two I can tell you, that this is definitely NOT the Empire Strikes Back of our generation. It has neither a plot twist like Empire and the good guys don't lose, instead they win pretty easily. So if you compare these two movies with another the only comman ground you will find is that both are the secon parts of their trilogies and that they are both sci-fi movies. That's the end of the tale.

So let's talk about the movie. I liked Dune Part aone because of the visuals and the soundtrack. The story was solid and entertaining but it didn't hook me that much. Also the characters are a bit too flat. If you look at the IMDb rating (8.0) you see that the general audience liked it but it is no masterpiece.

So my expectations for the second part were not that high and so they got surpassed, because this time the story got me. It just happened more and it felt like more action than in the first part. The visuals got even better, just take the black and white parts and Hans Zimmer's score is amazing again. The battle in the end was also satisfying and so this movie turns out be a pretty outstanding one.

And this is the time I have to return to my opening part, because unfortunately some people of our generation z have to make some stupid statements they know nothing about. Don't get me wrong, everybody has the right to rate this film like he wants. The problem I have is with those people saying things that are not true like comparing it with Empire Strikes Back or even Lord of the Rings.

If you had watched these movies you would know that they are not just better, but also completely different. So please stop telling us this rubbish all the time. It is so tiresome.",i sorri rip dream apart task get everybodi back ground clear internet misinform some peopl said movi would gener empir strike back ye somebodi wrote after watch dune part two i tell definit not empir strike back gener it neither plot twist like empir good guy dont lose instead win pretti easili so compar two movi anoth comman ground find secon part trilog scifi movi that end tale so let talk movi i like dune part aon visual soundtrack the stori solid entertain didnt hook much also charact bit flat if look imdb rate see gener audienc like masterpiec so expect second part high got surpass time stori got it happen felt like action first part the visual got even better take black white part han zimmer score amaz the battl end also satisfi movi turn pretti outstand one and time i return open part unfortun peopl gener z make stupid statement know noth dont get wrong everybodi right rate film like want the problem i peopl say thing true like compar empir strike back even lord ring if watch movi would know better also complet differ so plea stop tell u rubbish time it tiresom
"An epic masterpiece that is visually stunning and deeply moving. It is the cinematic adaptation that Frank Herbert's book deserved.

And the themes resonated profoundly, probably more so today than ever before. We follow the struggle of an indigenous people fighting against an imperialist morally corrupt and brutal oppressor. A fight for a better future to preserve a people's way of life and the the sacredness of an enchanted nature. All these topics deeply resonated within me, and I felt so moved I was at times shaking in my seat with the waves of emotions.

The soundtrack crafted by Hans Zimmer was as always fantastic and elevated some of the key moments of the film I can't wait to watch the third installment.",an epic masterpiec visual stun deepli move it cinemat adapt frank herbert book deserv and theme reson profoundli probabl today ever we follow struggl indigen peopl fight imperialist moral corrupt brutal oppressor a fight better futur preserv peopl way life sacred enchant natur all topic deepli reson within i felt move i time shake seat wave emot the soundtrack craft han zimmer alway fantast elev key moment film i cant wait watch third instal
"This is one of those hyped-up, elite-level blockbuster franchises that make you go into them feeling obliged to love and think the world of them as if your life were about to change forever and your eyes were about to open like never before, and then they make you feel guilty when you don't.

Where is the story?

Seriously, where is the plot?

Please name me one twist and turn; I dare you. I'm not asking for an audible-gasp, life-altering, earth-shattering twist and turn - just any twist and turn.

Not even one.

And I'm not even gonna go into the cultural appropriation nonsense.

I don't mind a little cultural appropriation, especially of my own Middle Eastern culture even, as long as you make it the least bit palatable and bare-minimum watchable. I absolutely would enjoy the prophecy of a White Man Savior (and his Maryesque-figure White Mother Oracle) who delivers the Arab-adjacent Native Desert Dwellers to Green Paradise, if you actually made an effort into making him and his Native love interest more likeable than the sleepy Timothée Chalamat and Zendaya.

""Lisan al Ghaib"" this, ""Lisan al Ghaib"" that - I seriously cannot believe I had the physical stamina to sit through five hours in total of this mind-numbing, soul-crushing, mortally boring script!

You'd think a movie franchise of this magnitude would have better writers, but hey, at least you saw a bunch of wannabe-Arabian-Bedouins ride giant sandworms into a sandstorm, and then into another sandstorm, and another, and another. My goodness.

Aside from all that, the movie looks terribly disjunct throughout. There's little logical sequential continuity from one scene to another. And believe me - I'm one for artistic leeway; I'm a big, huge fan of unconventional ways of storytelling in film and TV. But making a movie out of such obviously disconnected pieces strung end to end is definitely not the avant-grade artistic flair you think it is.

I rewatched Dune Part 1 before watching Part 2, and then I could not for the life of me understand how in all good conscience I'd given Part 1 a nine-star rating here on IMDb when I first watched it in theater four years ago. Still, it was certainly less horrible than Part 2, though. Perhaps Oscar Isaac was the one redeeming feature then.

And I certainly won't be holding my breath for Dune Part 3.

There are many franchises that didn't deserve to be cut short because of Big Corporate decisions, but somehow this one will survive. Because no matter what a tasteless, soulless, odious piece of pseudo-art these filmmakers will churn out, the millions upon millions will flock to the theaters for a chance to watch a superstar play hero and win the girl on an alien planet.

"Overall Dune Part Two is A Masterpiece and it's a visually appealing brilliant movie with a great storyline, fabulous visuals and sound design, a good tone and a expectional performance by all the cast of this movie just like the first part, Dune Part Two is a amazing movie too and the overall pacing of the movie is way better than the first part, all the cast of the movie have done an excellent job with some great action sequences too especially the end.

Overall Dune Part Two should only be watched at cinema and the main highlight is that it should only be watched in IMAX as the film is fully shot for it don't miss this one and go for it because it's a masterpiece movie that keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie A 9/10 for the movie.",overal dune part two a masterpiec visual appeal brilliant movi great storylin fabul visual sound design good tone expect perform cast movi like first part dune part two amaz movi overal pace movi way better first part cast movi done excel job great action sequenc especi end overal dune part two watch cinema main highlight watch imax film fulli shot dont miss one go masterpiec movi keep engag throughout whole movi a movi
"Hello again film friends, I hope you are all well. So Dune part two is finally here, and the one question I'm sure you're all asking is, well those of you that havent seen it yet anyway, does it live up to the hype? And let me answer with a very strong YES! It is a beautiful epic in every sense, the acting, the story, the images and of course the music. Everyone involved really brought their A-game and knew they were making something special. The story this time is much more evolved and even more enticing than part one. No spoilers here but if you enjoyed part one then you owe it to yourself to see the epic next chapter. There are so many exciting beautiful images in this story that my friends and I were grinning from ear to ear pretty much all the way through. I'm very happy for director Dennis Villenueve as his last beautiful epic Blade runner 2049 was VERY under appreciated and overlooked, but he is getting the recognition for his genius now at least with Dune. I will warm fans of the book tho that some things have been changed but the good news is that it doesn't spoil ANY of your enjoyment of this rendition of the story. There isn't really much else I can say at this point without giving away even the smallest of spoilers, I will redo my review once the bluray is in my greedy hands! Quick note, those of you that have a 3D set up you can actually buy part one in 3D!!! It was released in Germany I think and looks amazing in 3D! So anyway I'll wrap it up with advising you go and see this as soon as possible and also recommend seeing it in IMAX for the best experience possible! Thanks for reading and until the next time, stay safe and may the force be with you.",hello film friend i hope well so dune part two final one question im sure your ask well havent seen yet anyway live hype and let answer strong ye it beauti epic everi sen act stori imag cours music everyon involv realli brought agam knew make someth special the stori time much evolv even entic part one no spoiler enjoy part one owe see epic next chapter there mani excit beauti imag stori friend i grin ear ear pretti much way im happi director denni villenuev last beauti epic blade runner veri appreci overlook get recognit geniu least dune i warm fan book tho thing chang good news doesnt spoil ani enjoy rendit stori there isnt realli much el i say point without give away even smallest spoiler i redo review bluray greedi hand quick note d set actual buy part one d it releas germani i think look amaz d so anyway ill wrap advis go see soon possibl also recommend see imax best experi possibl thank read next time stay safe may forc
"One of the best films ever made. Visuals are amazing, sound is fantastic, action was superb... Ugh, just go see it. If anyone has any negativity about it, it's because they ""would have done it different if I were the director"". Jealousy is all that would cause someone to leave negative responses. This has climbed my list of best movies that lie with the original Jurassic Park and others. Even the fight\battle scenes were more exciting and well done than any others I've seen. The explosions were incredible and none of the CGI looked fake like in transformers movies.

"A modern scify classic. As far as possible of the stupidity of ideologies and modern day political standards. This is what we imagine when we dream about the Hollywood lost magic. The most pure sci-fi movie sin Dune part 1 and by far the best overall movie of te year.

Dune is a generational piece of art, a definition of "" how"" and ""when"" a bacon for new perspectives and a strong hit for the old school way of having the props. We are here to stand and wait for as long as it takes for the third part.

"Ok. So this movie has me re rating all the past movies I gave 10 rating to.

This movie has changed the way I look at movie vs cinema.

The acting is top notch from every character that plays a role in advancing the story. TC and Zen. Javier Bardem and Rebeca Ferguson. The acting tandems really worked well.

The cinematography is amazing. The lighting. The use of colors or no use of them in some scenes. The balance is perfect.

The original score really creates an immersive experience and makes you feel as if you are in the movie. The use of score in certain points really added to the experience of drama and tension that DV created.

The direction is top notch. This is probably the best movie in DV's career. This movie just keeps building on layers it create throughout this movie. The growth of characters. The story of how it all came to be is top notch.

Can't say more than this. Don't want to spoil the movie. I will recommend this film to everyone I talk to this year.

"I watched the first part in the cinemas. It was interesting and engaging. When I saw the trailer for this one, I was so excited to watch it. Finally it had arrived to the cinema, I bought my tickets, and then? Cought myself looking at the time an hour in, which I dont normally do.

Felt like the conversation between characters is so unnatural. For most parts it was even like they were just quoting ""meaningful"" lines to each other.

Also, the music which was great when it was first introduced to the film, became unbearable. I had a feeling that I watched 2 hours of eye contacts and worm riding with dramatic soundtrack.

Also I found that the end scene really had no heaviness to it, all though it was shown through, again a few dramatic lines from the characters.

Overall, interesting plot idea, shown too dramatical, it missed its point.",i watch first part cinema it interest engag when i saw trailer one i excit watch final arriv cinema i bought ticket cought look time hour i dont normal felt like convers charact unnatur for part even like quot meaning line also music great first introduc film becam unbear i feel i watch hour eye contact worm ride dramat soundtrack also i found end scene realli heavi though shown dramat line charact overal interest plot idea shown dramat miss point
"Loved the movie so much, the visuals are remarkable, the music, the storytelling, the acting, the costumes, everything was top notch!

Definitely has to be watched in IMAX.

The only thing I disliked was how Timothee and Zendaya have negative chemistry and you couldn't really buy into their romantic relationship, mostly from Zendaya's side. I honestly think she was the weakest link of this movie.

That being said, the movie was still 10/10, because it is so grand, few details can't diminish it.

Austin Butler was great, the guy can really act with solely a body language, without saying a word.

"There is no Jihad in Dune 2, despite the fact that that word, and its very specific meaning, are central to the novels that this film was based on.

I assume the filmmakers were too worried to use it, but this is far from being the only compromise on view here.

There is a tendency when a franchise is popular enough to just load in as many marquee Hollywood actors as possible, and this is a mistake. Here there are two pieces of completely insane casting. Florence Pugh looks like she has literally come from another universe. And Christopher Walken is absurdly himself, it's like he's not even trying to play the role.

Then there is Timothy Chalamonte. His agent says he hasn't had to audition for a role for seven years. Well, perhaps he should start again. His acting is more Hayden Christensen in Star Wars than Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.

The only person worse is Zendaya, who doesn't appear to be able to act at all, and goes into a perpetual sulk for the second half of what starts to feel like a very long movie. Her sins with Chalamonte are painful.

The film is, of course, redeemed by the most astonishing, visuals, production value, design, and science fiction vision. It is truly awesome to watch, except when the human actors are on the screen.

What else? It's way too long. And yet Austin Butler's baddie, who is easily the best thing in the Dine franchise so far, doesn't get nearly enough time on screen.",there jihad dune despit fact word specif mean central novel film base i assum filmmak worri use far compromis view there tendenc franchis popular enough load mani marque hollywood actor possibl mistak here two piec complet insan cast florenc pugh look like liter come anoth univers and christoph walken absurdli like he even tri play role then timothi chalamont hi agent say hasnt audit role seven year well perhap start hi act hayden christensen star war peter otool lawrenc arabia the person wors zendaya doesnt appear abl act goe perpetu sulk second half start feel like long movi her sin chalamont pain the film cours redeem astonish visual product valu design scienc fiction vision it truli awesom watch except human actor screen what el it way long and yet austin butler baddi easili best thing dine franchis far doesnt get nearli enough time screen
"There's not a lot you can pick apart in this movie. Pacing, progression, action, romance (well what romance there is in it), the way it was shot and the way Hans Zimmer works his magic as per usual. I wish I had read the books before viewing as the world building is so fascinating. I love that the world is sci-fi and includes the Fremen society as well. Which is very middle eastern based and include djinn and shamans. The combination of the two was such a wonderful idea that Dune novelist Frank Herbert had and I am thankful that he created this world for us to enjoy. Timothy does a great job as Paul and Zendaya as Chani. Austin Butler though, I was super pleased to hear him not sound like Elvis. He really played this character brutally and it was so necessary. Stellan Skarsgaard is incredible as you would expect and I could also picture Gary Oldman in the role as the baron as well (Just a side note). I would highly recommend watching this right after re-watching the first and enjoy it. I hope they build more on this universe.

"As a fan of syfy and basically read Herbert's books and his sons prequels and continued stories of Dune. This 2nd film far exceeded my imagination!! Granted the original Lynch film is STILL a cult for Dune. This adaptation is noted as grand, well written script, beautifully done cinematography; also the development of dialogue construction is sheer perfection and adding performance of the actors. How does a underdog become the hero and messiah of a planet? By going deep into character and emotion;in other words having the viewer believe they are the messiah and understanding the flaws, the soulful depth and pain of that character!! This film is now the mark the epilogue of cinematic excellence.

"This was a fantastic movie that has lived to the hype of the movie reviewers. I won't give away spoilers but watching this movie in Imax reminded me why I love the movie theaters and watching movies in that format. There's a level of focus that you can't replicate watching a movie at home. This movie is nearly 3 hours long and I never felt it drug on. One way I know I think a movie is too long is that I begin to get fidgety and start looking at the time. Never happened once for me. I hope movie theaters will never become a thing of the past like Blockbuster. The graphics, story line, and fantastic actors captivate you.

"The movie is amazing in so many ways.

While there have been more than a few adaptations of the books, this last Dune seems like an original piece of work.

The second part starts of with a little bit of a cheesy dialogue, but then it gets bigger than that.

The scenography, photography is stunning, and the sequence at Geidi Prime is simply phenomenal.

Sound and music is incredible and honestly it provides about 50% of the whole ambient.

The cast feels like a major name dropping, but in the end it is almost perfect.

The pace of storytelling is uneven and you do not have a good grip of how much time has passed for few scenes.

The prominent use of the Fremen language is also fantastic.

"One of the ongoing praises surrounding Villeneuve's Dune is that visual storytelling is making a comeback in cinema. And I concur.

David Lynch's ""Dune"" (1984) was an ambitious though somewhat misguided attempt at cramming the whole of Frank Herbert's first Dune novel into a single movie, resulting in a muddled incoherent plot that probably left everyone unfamiliar with the Dune franchise scratching their heads

As for Villeneuve's version, his film adaptation accomplishes exactly what any film version of a book should strive to do: Visual over verbal exposition. Villeneuve's depiction of Dune is nothing short of breathtaking and is a true visual feast that doesn't drag on for too long.",one ongo prais surround villeneuv dune visual storytel make comeback cinema and i concur david lynch dune ambiti though somewhat misguid attempt cram whole frank herbert first dune novel singl movi result muddl incoher plot probabl left everyon unfamiliar dune franchis scratch head a villeneuv version film adapt accomplish exactli film version book strive visual verbal exposit villeneuv depict dune noth short breathtak true visual feast doesnt drag long
"Dune II is very loud, and not just the sound track or effects. The characters, the actors, their masterful delivery, the settings, the dialogue, the writing, the storyline, the production, effects and photography, the direction; all these things vibrate with a heavy, redolent air of urgency, crisis and gravitas. There is an immense emotive weight behind this movie's production. The primary actors in this tale are powerful and astonishingly well portrayed. The heavy religious backstory which empowers this movie is unvoiced but dominant never the less. Violence, and there is no shortage of that, prevails, but seemingly it is more a response to genocidal repression than a specific ethnic pogrom, or politic strategy.

Even so, the response of the Freman to their attackers, is grounded, inherent and succinctly Neolithic in the timbre of its violence. Hand to hand interchanges with sacred blades, the teeth of the massive sand worms, leaves most foes with some serious linkage. Eventually, though, politics does win out. Where the third installment of this series will go, a la the original books' storyline, is difficult to conceive. This is not because it is not written, rather it's because it becomes harder to understand and relate to. At the end of the movie, the humble, self-effacing Paul Atreides seems left behind in the in escapably blind willingness to surrender to his own predestined fate as Emperor. Seemingly, the new Duke has become much more than human.",dune ii loud sound track effect the charact actor master deliveri set dialogu write storylin product effect photographi direct thing vibrat heavi redol air urgenc crisi gravita there immens emot weight behind movi product the primari actor tale power astonishingli well portray the heavi religi backstori empow movi unvoic domin never less violenc shortag prevail seemingli respons genocid repress specif ethnic pogrom polit strategi even respons freman attack ground inher succinctli neolith timbr violenc hand hand interchang sacr blade teeth massiv sand worm leav foe seriou linkag eventu though polit win where third instal seri go la origin book storylin difficult conceiv thi written rather becom harder understand relat at end movi humbl selfeffac paul atreid seem left behind escap blind willing surrend predestin fate emperor seemingli new duke becom much human
"Dune: Part Two was a big letdown for me after the first movie. I think this movie should have been two movies in itself. Eventhough the film is almost 3 hours long, so many things happen throghout the story that we barely get to be within the same timframe and place for more than 5 minutes. We often jump days or weeks between scenes, sometimes multiple times within a few minutes. Even the important events are not shown in detail. Characters who were built up for hours during the first movie become irrelevant and die within 5 minutes in this movie. The fights scenes are few, unimpressive and short.",dune part two big letdown first movi i think movi two movi eventhough film almost hour long mani thing happen throghout stori bare get within timfram place minut we often jump day week scene sometim multipl time within minut even import event shown detail charact built hour first movi becom irrelev die within minut movi the fight scene unimpress short
"First one was great. Too long for nothing. Was hopeful for the second one but disappointed. What a grandeur and spectacle movie with no emotion, no mysteries and plainly given plot. You know what's coming next all the time. No excitement. 2.5 stars is for production design and sound.

I don't feel along with the characters, their excitement, fear, hope. Nothing really nothing. Just a flat boring movie with cool visuals. The first one was great that you feel Lego's fear, Paul's journey and other developments.

"I do love Sci-fi. I watch so many movies.... But....finally !

Denis Villeneuve, thank you so much!

This movie is so beautiful, clever and epic. Far better than any sci-fi movie, ever ! And not for kids, for grown ups!

Thank you! With full sentences and clever people.

Beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. Ships, costumes, landscapes, weapons.

We do all know Dune is not an easy book to work on. It's close to a political essay about ecology and religion. I remember how cautious I was, not so happy about the casting, before watching the first part and I was finally so convinced.. And the second one is even better!

WOW ! I'm really blown away!

Great great villains in a movie, finally! Not some angry teenage, a ""Darkkevin66"" ! Real psychopaths.

BUT, not a white and black situation at all. The ""good ones"" show a dark face too and a very awful one. Fundamentalism. Religious and political manipulations, sneaky moves, very violent issues. I won't spoil that.

Go watch this movie.

Harkonnens are frightful, Christopher Walken is a great Emperor and I really do like Stilgar.

Special mention to Zendaya and Timothy Chalamet.

I'm not a big fan of these actors. But : Zendaya is a real fighter, a rebel who knows well who his lover is, and shows with a very nice self-restrain her concerns and unhappiness. And Timothy Chalamet is really moving, torn between his vision of a dark future, the injonctions of the Fremens beliefs, the manipulations of the Bene Gesserit, her mother (a great vengeful Jessica), and his love for Chani.

Never thought I will ever find this actor so moving. I was wrong. Great with sorrow and torn feelings, like with anger and harsh determination.

The bad part : too long to wait for the third part and no directors's cut, Denis Villeneuve said.

I have to watch it again, at least three or four times.
